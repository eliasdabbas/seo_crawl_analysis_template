This approach is good if you know exactly what you are looking for (and not checking if there are hidden pages, or issues with the sitemaps). You might use this for monitoring purposes as well.\n",
    "2. **Crawl the website starting from the home page and following links (`follow_links=True`):** This might be a better approach for an SEO audit because you crawl independently from the sitemap and can then compare the URLs you were able to discover through links with what is available in the sitemap. You might discover pages that are not in the sitemaps and vice versa, and this can really help in understanding some issues you might come across. I recommend the second approach for this situation, but I did the first one as this is just to demonstrate a way for exploring the output file.  \n",

    "Now, we'll take the unique sitemaps, crawl each set of URLs separately, and save each output to a different file. "
