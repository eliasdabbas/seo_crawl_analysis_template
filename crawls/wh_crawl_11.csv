					 Most Americans may not think about the Federal Government every day—but when they need Government services, they expect them to work. The business of the Federal Government is to serve the American people. But public trust in Government is declining to near-historic lows because it’s not meeting the American people’s expectations. Government must transform its outdated approaches, technology, and skillsets so that the workforce of today can meet the needs and expectations of the public tomorrow. Rather than pursue short-term fixes that quickly become outdated, this Administration is investing in deep-seated transformation through the President’s Management Agenda. This agenda lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the Federal Government in key areas that will improve the ability of agencies to work on behalf of the American people to: Deliver mission outcomes, Provide excellent service, and Effectively steward taxpayer dollars. To move from vision to action, the Administration will focus on modernizing three key drivers of transformation: Modern information technology (IT)  will function as the backbone of how Government serves the public in ways that meet their expectations and keep sensitive data and systems secure. Data, accountability, and transparency  will provide the tools to deliver visibly better results to the public and hold agencies accountable to taxpayers. A modern workforce  that builds on the Administration’s proposed civil service reforms to empower senior leaders and front-line managers to align staff skills with evolving mission needs. In order to advance change across the Federal enterprise, the President’s Management Agenda is establishing Cross-Agency Priority—or CAP—goals for each of the three key areas.  These CAP Goal will be led by an interagency team of senior Federal leaders and staff. Because accountability is important part of the PMA, CAP goal results will be tracked publicly each quarter online at  www.performance.gov/PMA  .

					 Management 					 eGov (OFCIO) OFFM OFPP OPPM PMA GovReform 				 Office of Management and Budget View the Gov Reform Plan (PDF) In today’s digital age, the Federal Government is not suited to meet the needs of its customer, the American people. Outdated technology, organizational constructs, and antiquated processes keep citizens and small businesses tied up in bureaucracy, leaving the American people and Federal workforce frustrated. Having to work through multiple Federal agencies to conduct business or solve simple problems is not an efficient or effective use of taxpayer resources. For example, a poultry company in Georgia has to fill out separate paperwork because chickens and eggs are regulated by different Federal agencies. And because of the toppings, a frozen cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza are regulated by different agencies. There needs to be a better way. With today’s technology, if we can order a car from our smartphone, we should be able to easily communicate with a Federal worker when needed. President Trump understands this frustration and the need to have a modern and efficient Federal Government that better serves the American people. This is why the President once again opted to put the American people first and demanded change. An  Executive Order (EO)  issued last March directed the proposal of a comprehensive plan to reform the Federal Government to be more efficient, effective and accountable. Paired with the  President’s Management Agenda , this EO and the Administration’s plan build on a history of bipartisan Government reform initiatives that will hold our Government accountable and put you, the American taxpayer, first. The Administration’s plan serves as a cornerstone for productive, bipartisan dialogue on realigning the Federal Government to more effectively operate in the 21st century.

 Contact Live Press enter to search",61386,Government Reform,,"Office of Management and Budget@@In today’s digital age, the Federal Government is not suited to meet the needs of its customer, the American people. Outdated technology, organizational constructs, and antiquated processes keep citizens and small businesses tied up in bureaucracy, leaving the American people and Federal workforce frustrated.@@Having to work through multiple Federal agencies to conduct business or solve simple problems is not an efficient or effective use of taxpayer resources. For example, a poultry company in Georgia has to fill out separate paperwork because chickens and eggs are regulated by different Federal agencies. And because of the toppings, a frozen cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza are regulated by different agencies. There needs to be a better way. With today’s technology, if we can order a car from our smartphone, we should be able to easily communicate with a Federal worker when needed.@@President Trump understands this frustration and the need to have a modern and efficient Federal Government that better serves the American people. This is why the President once again opted to put the American people first and demanded change. An @@ issued last March directed the proposal of a comprehensive plan to reform the Federal Government to be more efficient, effective and accountable. Paired with the @@, this EO and the Administration’s plan build on a history of bipartisan Government reform initiatives that will hold our Government accountable and put you, the American taxpayer, first. The Administration’s plan serves as a cornerstone for productive, bipartisan dialogue on realigning the Federal Government to more effectively operate in the 21st century.",,180.0,www.whitehouse.gov,0.26836180686950684,0,200,https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/government-reform/#main-content@@https://www.whitehouse.gov@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/government-reform/?utm_source=link&utm_medium=header@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/economy-jobs/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/national-security-defense/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/budget-spending/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/@@http://www.coronavirus.gov@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/search/@@https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=1790466490985150&display=popup&quote=Government%20Reform&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fomb%2Fmanagement%2Fgovernment-reform%2F%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook@@https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fomb%2Fmanagement%2Fgovernment-reform%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter&text=Government%20Reform&via=whitehouse@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/government-reform/?utm_source=link@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/government-reform/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-trump-administration/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-for-agencies/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/office-u-s-intellectual-property-enforcement-coordinator-ipec/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/legislative/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/egov/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/office-federal-financial-management/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/office-federal-procurement-policy/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/office-performance-personnel-management/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/pma/@@https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/16/2017-05399/comprehensive-plan-for-reorganizing-the-executive-branch@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/@@https://apply.whitehouse.gov/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/copyright/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/privacy-policy/@@https://twitter.com/whitehouse@@https://www.facebook.com/WhiteHouse/@@https://www.instagram.com/whitehouse/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/healthcare/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/donald-j-trump/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/mike-pence/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/melania-trump/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/karen-pence/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-trump-administration/the-cabinet/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/disclosures/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/tours-events/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/first-ladies/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-grounds/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/write-or-call/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/internships/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/fellows/,"Skip to content@@

As a teacher, school nurse, social worker, school administrator, or other school staff member, you have the power to intervene early to prevent and confront substance abuse and foster safe learning environments for students. Research tells us there is a connection between drug use and poor academic performance. Unfortunately, substance abuse can start at an early age and negatively impact academic achievement and student success.  Typically, substance use increases nine-fold between the ages of 12 and 18. [1]  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that 48 percent of youth earning the grades of D’s and F’s in school had used marijuana in the past month, and 62 percent of youth earning these low grades drank alcohol in the past month. [2] Evidence-based prevention programs, delivered in school settings, can be a valuable way to reduce drug use among youth and help them succeed academically.

OIRA is the United States Government’s central authority for the review of Executive Branch regulations, approval of Government information collections, establishment of Government statistical practices, and coordination of Federal privacy policy. The office is comprised of six subject matter branches and is led by the OIRA Administrator, who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate. In addition to reviewing drafts of proposed and final regulations under a variety of statutory and Executive Order authorities, OIRA also coordinates retrospective review of regulation under Executive Order 13610, reviews and approves Government collections of information from the public under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and oversees the implementation of Government-wide policies in the areas of information policy, privacy, and statistical policy. OIRA also coordinates agency implementation of the Information Quality Act, including the peer review practices of agencies, and participates in implementation of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement and Fairness Act (SBREFA). Finally, OIRA coordinates the Administration’s efforts to improve regulatory cooperation with our key trading partners, including Canada and Mexico. Rules under review.  Information about the Administration’s regulatory actions can be found on  www.reginfo.gov , a website that makes information about OIRA’s review of regulations under Executive Order 12866 available to the public and features information about public meetings that OIRA conducts. It also contains information concerning implementation of Executive Order 13771 and Executive Order 13777.

					The National Security Council (NSC) is the President's principal forum for considering national security and foreign policy matters with his senior national security advisors and cabinet officials. Since its inception under President Truman, the Council's function has been to advise and assist the President on national security and foreign policies. The Council also serves as the President's principal arm for coordinating these policies among various government agencies.

The Federal Government largely has missed out on that transformation due to poor management of technology investments, with IT projects too often costing hundreds of millions of dollars more than they should, taking years longer than necessary to deploy, and delivering technologies that are obsolete by the time they are completed. We are working to close the resulting gap between the best performing private sector organizations and the federal government. The Office of E-Government and Information Technology (E-Gov), headed by the Federal Government’s Chief Information Officer (CIO), develops and provides direction in the use of Internet-based technologies to make it easier for citizens and businesses to interact with the Federal Government, save taxpayer dollars, and streamline citizen participation.

 FEA Success Stories 
 These stories highlight where agencies have applied enterprise architecture methodologies to solve specific business problems which has resulted in programmatic success. They highlight where agencies have applied enterprise architecture methodologies to solve specific business problems which has resulted in programmatic success. Each quarter, the FEAPMO will feature new success stories as identified by the agencies. 
 DOD Success Story 
 The DoD’s High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) is responsible for providing some of the world’s most advanced computing capability in support of the DoD mission. The nation-wide Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) provides the HPCMP user community with protocol-rich, high-availability, high-capacity, low-latency, secure connectivity. In June, 2003, the DREN was designated as the first DoD IPv6 pilot network. This DOD success highlights six keys to success and eight challenges that were overcome without additional personnel and with less than $100,000 in additional funding. 
 EPA Success Story 
 Each year Industry reports toxics releases to EPA which is shared with State agencies. The 2007 TRI-MEweb significantly reduces the reporting burden of facilities filing via web, abates EPA and state programs data collection transaction costs, and delivers impressive program performance efficiencies. The 2007 TRI-MEweb is a leap forward towards a one-stop-shop paperless TRI reporting system. 
 FBI Success Story 
 In late 2007, former Associate Deputy Director, Joseph L. Ford, determined that centrally managing license agreements for Information Technology (IT) was a critical need and would provide an opportunity for huge cost savings and improved efficiencies. During just four quarters of its existence, the program has proved its worth by recording a total FY 2008 cost savings/avoidance of $14,869,700, while also recording an additional $49,394,266 in out-year cost savings for FY 2009 through FY 2012.

The Federal Government largely has missed out on that transformation due to poor management of technology investments, with IT projects too often costing hundreds of millions of dollars more than they should, taking years longer than necessary to deploy, and delivering technologies that are obsolete by the time they are completed. We are working to close the resulting gap between the best performing private sector organizations and the federal government.@@The Office of E-Government and Information Technology (E-Gov), headed by the Federal Government’s Chief Information Officer (CIO), develops and provides direction in the use of Internet-based technologies to make it easier for citizens and businesses to interact with the Federal Government, save taxpayer dollars, and streamline citizen participation.@@ | @@ | @@ | @@ | @@ | @@A complete list of OMB @@is available for your review on the WhiteHouse.gov site.

They highlight where agencies have applied enterprise architecture methodologies to solve specific business problems which has resulted in programmatic success. Each quarter, the FEAPMO will feature new success stories as identified by the agencies.@@The DoD’s High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) is responsible for providing some of the world’s most advanced computing capability in support of the DoD mission. The nation-wide Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) provides the HPCMP user community with protocol-rich, high-availability, high-capacity, low-latency, secure connectivity. In June, 2003, the DREN was designated as the first DoD IPv6 pilot network. This DOD success highlights six keys to success and eight challenges that were overcome without additional personnel and with less than $100,000 in additional funding.@@Each year Industry reports toxics releases to EPA which is shared with State agencies. The 2007 TRI-MEweb significantly reduces the reporting burden of facilities filing via web, abates EPA and state programs data collection transaction costs, and delivers impressive program performance efficiencies. The 2007 TRI-MEweb is a leap forward towards a one-stop-shop paperless TRI reporting system.@@In late 2007, former Associate Deputy Director, Joseph L. Ford, determined that centrally managing license agreements for Information Technology (IT) was a critical need and would provide an opportunity for huge cost savings and improved efficiencies. During just four quarters of its existence, the program has proved its worth by recording a total FY 2008 cost savings/avoidance of $14,869,700, while also recording an additional $49,394,266 in out-year cost savings for FY 2009 through FY 2012.@@These case studies are for information purposes only and can be used by the architectural community to highlight specific examples from Federal Agencies throughout their agency or organization.@@The following case study demonstrates how the Food and Drug Administration used Enterprise Architecture to standardize business processes and achieve

The Director of OMB delegates these responsibilities to the OIRA Administrator. Among the responsibilities of OIRA’s Statistical and Science Policy office, headed by the Chief Statistician of the United States, are the promotion of the quality of Federal statistical information that facilitates evidence-based policies and programs and the viability of the underlying systems that produce that information. This is accomplished by ensuring budget proposals are consistent with system-wide priorities; establishing standards and guidance for data collection and dissemination; assessing agency compliance with those standards; coordinating interagency and international statistical activities; and reviewing Federal statistical programs. Federal statistics are essential to inform private and public decision-making across our Nation. Thirteen principal Federal statistical agencies and three recognized statistical units (agencies whose principal mission is to produce official Federal statistics) are joined by over 100 other Federal programs in statistical activities spanning measurement, information collection, statistical products, data management, and dissemination.

					The President’s Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB), with its component Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB), is an independent element within the Executive Office of the President.  For more than six decades the PIAB has offered the President expert advice on the conduct of U.S. intelligence.  Throughout its history, the Board has closely guarded its special status by making every effort to ensure the strict confidentiality of its deliberations and communications, and the objectivity of its advice.  As a result, the Board has had immense and long-lasting impacts on the structure, management, and operations of U.S. intelligence.

					 President Eisenhower created the President’s Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities in 1956, after concluding that he needed an outside body of highly respected and accomplished Americans to give him unfettered and candid appraisals of U.S. intelligence activities. President Kennedy renamed it the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) in 1961, and it has served every President except for President Carter, who abolished the Board in 1977. President Reagan re-instituted the PFIAB in 1981, and in 2008 President Bush renamed it the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board to reflect the fact that national intelligence does not begin or end at our Nation’s borders. The PIAB exists exclusively to assist the President by providing him with an independent source of advice on the effectiveness with which the Intelligence Community is meeting the Nation’s intelligence needs, and the vigor and insight with which the community plans for the future. The Board has access to all information needed to perform its functions and has direct access to the President. The Board reports its findings and recommendations on improving the performance of intelligence entities to the President as necessary, but not less than twice each year. On behalf of the President, the Board assesses issues pertaining to the quality, quantity, and adequacy of intelligence activities; effectiveness of organizational structure, management, and personnel; and performance of all agencies of the Federal Government engaged in the collection, evaluation, or production of intelligence or the execution of intelligence policy. President Ford created the IOB in 1976 in response to recommendations made by the Rockefeller Commission calling for a Presidential-level body with specific oversight responsibilities for the legality and propriety of U.S. intelligence activities. The IOB oversees the Intelligence Community’s compliance with the Constitution and all applicable laws, Executive Orders, and Presidential Directives. It complements and supplements, rather than duplicates the oversight roles of the Director of National Intelligence, Department and Agency Inspectors General and General Counsels, and the Congressional Oversight Committees. In reviewing the legality and propriety of intelligence activities, the Board advises the President on intelligence activities that the Board believes may be unlawful or contrary to Executive Order or Presidential Directive; are not being adequately addressed by the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, or the head of the department or agency concerned; or should be immediately brought to his attention.

Trump signed  Executive Order (EO) 13807  titled “Establishing Discipline and Accountability in the Environmental Review and Permitting Process for Infrastructure,” which was published in the Federal Register on August 24, 2017.  82 FR 40463 . The Executive Order seeks to reduce the unnecessary burdens and uncertainties of the Federal regulatory process that can delay major infrastructure projects and hold back the American economy. On September 14, 2017,  CEQ  pu blished  a notice  in the Federal Register announcing an initial list of actions  to enhance and modernize the Federal environmental review and authorization process for infrastructure projects. To comply with Section 5(d) of EO 13807, CEQ will refer various requests for designation of State projects pursuant to  EO 13766  to the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, Department of Transportation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as appropriate.  CEQ will, as appropriate in response to any additional requests from States, refer projects that qualify for designation as high priority projects in accordance with Section 5(d) of EO 13807.  The Federal Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard  tracks the Federal government’s environmental review and authorization processes for covered major infrastructure projects. To comply with Section 5(b) EO 13807, on March 20, 2018, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and CEQ signed a Memorandum titled “One Federal Decision Framework for the Environmental Review and Authorization Process for Major Infrastructure Projects under Executive Order 13807.” Pursuant to that Memorandum, federal agencies signed a One Federal Decision Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which was announced on April 9, 2018.  Signatories to the MOU include the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, and Homeland Security, Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council. To comply with Section 5(e) of EO 13807, including a review of existing CEQ regulations and guidance, on June 20, 2018, CEQ issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking titled “Update to the Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act,” seeking comment on potential revisions to update and clarify CEQ’s NEPA regulations. On June 21, 2019, CEQ also issued “Draft [NEPA] Guidance on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions,” and has requested public comment. To comply with Section 5(b)(iv)(C) of EO 13807, on February 26, 2019, OMB and CEQ  issued guidance for states with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) assignment responsibilities under the Surface Transportation Program. On June 28, 2019, OMB and CEQ also issued guidance on the application of the One Federal Decision policy to entities assuming Department of Housing and Urban Development environmental review responsibilities.

Trump signed an Executive Order establishing the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. As detailed in its  charter , the Commission served as an advisory board and made recommendations regarding policies and practices for combating the addiction—and, specifically, the opioid—crisis in this country. The Commission was chaired by Governor Chris Christie and was also comprised of Governor Charlie Baker, Governor Roy Cooper, Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy, Dr. Bertha Madras, and Florida Attorney General Pamela Bondi. The Commission disbanded in late 2017 after completing its  final report  to the President. This report envisioned a comprehensive solution to the addiction crisis that leveraged expertise and resources from across the Federal government. One year later, the government has made  substantial progress  in implementing the Commission’s recommendations. MEETINGS The Commission met five times before the release of its final report. Documents and details of the five meetings are posted below.

In 2018, the HIDTAs seized an estimated $16.5 billion in illicit drugs and cash—representing a Return on Investment of $64 for every $1 budgeted for the HIDTA program. Removing drugs from our streets.  By interdicting and seizing drugs off our shores and within our borders, HIDTAs remove the supply of illicit substances, making it harder for drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) to sell their products. In 2018, the HIDTA program seized and disposed of over 1,907 tons of marijuana, 198 tons of cocaine products, 84 tons of meth, 7 tons of heroin, and 2 tons of fentanyl. Dismantling drug trafficking organizations . By targeting drug trafficking organizations, the HIDTAs focus on the entities responsible for the majority of the production, movement, and sales of illicit drugs. Last year, the HIDTAs disrupted and dismantled over 2,900 DTOs, 58% of which were part of international or multi-state operations. 
 
Promoting best practices and innovations . Because of the HIDTA program’s national footprint, law enforcement officials (LEOs) across the country can share their best practices and information with each other and, because of ONDCP’s neutrality, the HIDTAs can share on-the-ground intelligence with Federal agencies for better anti-drug policy. 
 
Preventing substance abuse through comprehensive anti-drug programming.  By establishing alliances with public health, healthcare, education, recreation, and other relevant sectors, the HIDTAs help create comprehensive community-based prevention efforts.    Enhancing officers’ safety and coordination.  The systems and procedures ONDCP developed for its HIDTA helped LEOs share more than 1.2 million pieces of evidence to unearth connections between cases and perform over 310,000 event deconflictions, actions that can alert LEOs when their tactical operations are occurring in the same general location and timeframe as other agencies. This has reduced unnecessary officer injuries and helped increase arrest and conviction rates. Live Jobs Get Involved Copyright Policy Privacy Policy Twitter Facebook Instagram Contact News

		 Decreasing youth substance use . Youth substance use significantly decreases in communities with a DFC coalition. The graphs above show the percentage of students in communities with a DFC coalition who reported they had abstained from a drug in the past 30 days. In addition to the substances listed above, almost all current DFC coalitions have identified opioids—including prescription drugs, heroin, and synthetic opioids like fentanyl—as one of their top five target substances. Reaching youth across the country.  In FY 2017, an estimated 63 million—or 1 in 5—Americans lived in a community with a DFC coalition, and since the program’s inception in 1997, over 154 million—or nearly half of all Americans—have lived in a community with a DFC coalition. Currently, the program reaches an estimated 2.5 million middle school students and 3.6 million high school students. By funding coalitions in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, the DFC program helps youth across the country and of all demographic and socio-economic statuses to live drug-free lives. Funding comprehensive solutions to youth substance use.  By requiring representation from each of the 12 sectors, the DFC program helped mobilize an estimated 33,500 members representing everything from youth groups to local media, religious/fraternal organizations to the private sector, and law enforcement (including ONDCP’s HIDTAs) to educational institutions. This diversity in membership helps coalitions connect their communities’ resources to each other and develop comprehensive anti-substance use programming.

For newly-formed coalitions The DFC Mentoring (DFC-M) grants provide existing DFCs with up to $75,000 per year in ONDCP funding to mentor newly-formed coalitions that are not statutorily eligible to apply for the DFC Support program. It is the intent of the DFC-M program that, at the end of the mentoring grant, each mentee coalition will meet all of the Statutory Eligibility Requirements of the DFC Support Program and be fully prepared to compete for the DFC grant. Eligible applicants are currently-funded DFC grant recipients with a coalition that has been in existence for at least five years; have an active DFC grant at the time of the application; and are in good standing with the DFC program. For DFCs seeking to address opioid misuse in their communities DFCs seeking to prevent and reduce youth (12 – 18) misuse of opioids (including prescription medications) and methamphetamines can apply for $50,000 per year for three years through the Community-Based Coalition Enhancement Grants to Address Local Drug Crisis (CARA) program. In FY 2018, ONDCP awarded  55 DFCs  in  37 states  with CARA grants. Current or former DFC grant recipients can apply for this grant. Coalitions receiving CARA funds are expected to work with leaders in their communities to create sustainable community-level reductions in local youth opioid, methamphetamine, and/or prescription medication misuse.

To empower the next generation of leaders, ONDCP’s National Youth Leadership Initiative (NYLI) provides training and guidance on organizational management, communication, and other skills to youth leaders and their adult advisors who are working to impact a broad range of public issues in their communities. The current recipient of this grant is  Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America  (CADCA) which has trained over 1,500 coalitions and 21,600 youth through its National Coalition Academy, NYLI, and online classrooms and webinars. For nonprofits working in economically disadvantaged areas DFCs and community teams seeking to work in economically disadvantaged areas can receive guidance and training on best practices, evaluation tools, and research-based anti-drug methodologies through the National Community Anti-Drug Coalition Institute (NCI).

In drug courts, judges, prosecutors, treatment providers, defense attorneys, probation and law enforcement officers work together to help those struggling with substance use and mental health disorders receive the treatment they need to achieve lasting recovery. Research shows drug courts reduce recidivism and crime while saving money. In addition, drug courts have been found to improve housing, employment, family reunification and financial stability. The Office of National Drug Control Policy’s Drug Court Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) grant seeks to enhance and increase adoption of this model by providing governments and drug courts at the state and local levels the tools they need to develop, maintain, and enhance evidence-based interventions. The recipient of the 2018 – 2020 TTA grant is the  National Association of Drug Court Professionals  (NADCP), a national membership organization which supports over 30,000 justice and treatment professionals at over 3,000 courts with training, consultation, and technical assistance. The 2018-2020 TTA grant supported the following NADCP initiatives: Pocket guides  on medication-assisted treatment to educate drug court clinicians, team members and participants; The utilization of the NADCP  Adult Drug Court Best Practice Standards  in all training programs and publications; Training and technical assistance  to ensure fidelity to the drug court model; A  dynamic toolkit  to address equity and inclusion in drug courts; and The ARK , an online tool that assesses an individual’s risk profile and provides recommendations on evidence-based and promising programs matched to that individual.     Live Jobs Get Involved Copyright Policy Privacy Policy Twitter Facebook Instagram Contact News

The   Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994  expanded ONDCP’s mission to include assessing budgets and resources related to the National Drug Control Strategy. Executive Orders 12880 (1993) ,    12992 (1996)   and  13023 (1996 )  tasked ONDCP with the responsibility to lead the United States’ drug-control policy and reiterated that ONDCP’s Director is the Executive Branch’s senior drug control policy official. The  Drug Free Communities Act of 1997  authorized ONDCP to carry out a national initiative that awards Federal grants directly to community coalitions. The  Media Campaign Act of 1998  directed ONDCP to conduct a national media campaign for the purpose of reducing and preventing drug use among young people in the United States. The Office of National Drug Control Policy  Reauthorization Act of 1998  expanded ONDCP’s mandate and authority, including: Development of a long-term national drug control strategy; Implementation of a robust performance-measurement system; Commitment to a five-year national drug-control program budget; Permanent authority for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas grant program; Increased reporting to Congress on drug-control activities; Reorganization of ONDCP to allow more effective national leadership; and Improved coordination among national drug-control program agencies. Executive Order 13165 (2000)   created the White House Task Force on Drug Use in Sports. It authorized the Director of ONDCP to serve as the U.S. Government’s representative on the board of the World Anti-Doping Agency. The  ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006  reauthorized ONDCP through FY 2010 and expanded the mandate of the Agency, including: Statutorily creating the position of the U.S. Interdiction Coordinator (USIC) and the Interdiction Committee (TIC) within ONDCP; Adding faith-based organizations and tribal officials to the National Drug Control Strategy consultation list; and Establishing a HIDTA designation petition process. The  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act  was signed into law by President Trump in October 2018. The SUPPORT Act reauthorized ONDCP through FY 2023, expanded ONDCP’s mandate, and made other changes, including: Reauthorizing the HIDTA and Drug Free Communities grant programs at ONDCP; Creating an Emerging Threats Committee tasked with proactively identifying and preparing for the next drug crises; Allowing a portion of HIDTA funds to be used for prevention and treatment; Creating an online Drug Control Data Dashboard with search functions; Creating a Grant Tracking System to better track and improve federal drug grants; and Creating a cadre of coordinators at ONDCP to lead efforts on key drug issues.   Live Jobs Get Involved Copyright Policy Privacy Policy Twitter Facebook Instagram Contact News

Advisory: Fentanyl Safety Recommendations for First Responders First responders are increasingly likely to encounter fentanyl in their daily activities. To help first responders protect themselves when an encounter with fentanyl is suspected, ONDCP and its Federal interagency partners developed a one-pager on evidence-based practices (available in  8.5” x 11”  and  11” x 17” ) and a companion  training video .

In response, ONDCP and its Federal interagency partners unveiled the following advisories on how businesses can protect themselves and curb drug production and trafficking through public-private collaboration: A  summary sheet  which outlines these documents; A  Manufacturing advisory  which describes how businesses can identify illicit fentanyl manufacturing; A  Marketing advisory  to help businesses prevent DTOs from using social media, e-commerce sites, and online forums to advertise and sell drugs; A  Movement advisory  to help businesses prevent DTOs from exploiting vulnerabilities in corporate supply chains to move drugs; and A  Money advisory  to alert financial institutions on how to detect and report illicit financial schemes and money laundering operations.

In 2017, over 70,000 Americans died from an overdose, an increase of 45% over the previous year. The overdose epidemic has affected Americans of all races, age groups, and socioeconomic statuses, and it has devastated families in urban and rural areas alike. Overdoses now kill more Americans than suicides, motor vehicle accidents, firearms, and homicides, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) points to overdoses as a key contributor to the drop in Americans’ life expectancy. The rise of overdose deaths in the United States has been largely driven by an increase in opioid-related deaths. Opioids—including prescription painkillers, heroin, and fentanyl—were responsible for 68% of overdoses in 2017. An estimated 2 million Americans are currently battling opioid addiction, and in 2017, the Council of Economic Advisors  estimated  that the Opioid Crisis was costing the United States over half a trillion dollars in lost productivity, premature deaths, and increased healthcare and criminal justice costs. More data about the drug crisis—including assessments of current drug use and drug-induced morbidity and mortality—can be found in ONDCP’s  Data Supplement . After his inauguration, President Donald J. Trump established the  President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis  to provide its recommendations on how the Federal government should respond to this crisis. Shortly thereafter, he declared the  Opioid Crisis  a public health emergency. Since then, the government has spent or allocated over $12.9 Billion to address opioid misuse.   Live Jobs Get Involved Copyright Policy Privacy Policy Twitter Facebook Instagram Contact News

The overdose epidemic has affected Americans of all races, age groups, and socioeconomic statuses, and it has devastated families in urban and rural areas alike. Overdoses now kill more Americans than suicides, motor vehicle accidents, firearms, and homicides, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) points to overdoses as a key contributor to the drop in Americans’ life expectancy.@@The rise of overdose deaths in the United States has been largely driven by an increase in opioid-related deaths. Opioids—including prescription painkillers, heroin, and fentanyl—were responsible for 68% of overdoses in 2017. An estimated 2 million Americans are currently battling opioid addiction, and in 2017, the Council of Economic Advisors @@ that the Opioid Crisis was costing the United States over half a trillion dollars in lost productivity, premature deaths, and increased healthcare and criminal justice costs. More data about the drug crisis—including assessments of current drug use and drug-induced morbidity and mortality—can be found in ONDCP’s @@.@@After his inauguration, President Donald J. Trump established the @@ to provide its recommendations on how the Federal government should respond to this crisis. Shortly thereafter, he declared the @@ a public health emergency. Since then, the government has spent or allocated over $12.9 Billion to address opioid misuse.@@ ",,180.0,www.whitehouse.gov,0.5491399765014648,0,200,https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-administrations-approach/the-drug-crisis/#main-content@@https://www.whitehouse.gov@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-administrations-approach/the-drug-crisis/?utm_source=link&utm_medium=header@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/economy-jobs/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/national-security-defense/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/budget-spending/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/@@http://www.coronavirus.gov@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/search/@@https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=1790466490985150&display=popup&quote=The%20Drug%20Crisis&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fondcp%2Fthe-administrations-approach%2Fthe-drug-crisis%2F%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook@@https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fondcp%2Fthe-administrations-approach%2Fthe-drug-crisis%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter&text=The%20Drug%20Crisis&via=whitehouse@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-administrations-approach/the-drug-crisis/?utm_source=link@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-administrations-approach/the-drug-crisis/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-trump-administration/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-administrations-approach/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-administrations-approach/the-administrations-strategy/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-administrations-approach/presidents-commission-opioids/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-hidta-program/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-hidta-program/overview/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-hidta-program/designation-process/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-hidta-program/program-impacts/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-dfc-program/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-dfc-program/overview/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-dfc-program/application-process/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-dfc-program/program-impacts/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/the-dfc-program/enhancement-grants/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/other-grant-programs/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/other-grant-programs/anti-doping-clean-sport/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/other-grant-programs/drug-courts-training/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/other-grant-programs/model-state-anti-drug-laws/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/about/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/about/authorizations/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/about/budget-performance-data/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/about/advisories/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/about/foia-and-legal/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/about/contact-us/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/?post_type=eop-component&p=199731&preview=true@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/opioids/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/@@https://apply.whitehouse.gov/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/copyright/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/privacy-policy/@@https://twitter.com/whitehouse@@https://www.facebook.com/WhiteHouse/@@https://www.instagram.com/whitehouse/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/healthcare/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/donald-j-trump/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/mike-pence/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/melania-trump/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/karen-pence/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-trump-administration/the-cabinet/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/disclosures/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/tours-events/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/first-ladies/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-grounds/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/write-or-call/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/internships/@@https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/fellows/,"Skip to content@@

					 Contact 									 Council on Environmental Quality Infrastructure The Administration strongly supports the development of modern, resilient infrastructure, including for the transportation, water, energy, and other critical sectors of our economy. For many infrastructure projects, the permitting process can be fragmented, inefficient, unpredictable, and costly. Executive Order 13807 Recognizing these challenges, in August 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 13807, to reduce unnecessary duplication and uncertainty in the Federal environmental review and authorization process that can delay major infrastructure projects and hold back the American economy. EO 13807, titled, “Establishing Discipline and Accountability in the Environmental Review and Permitting Process for Infrastructure Projects” 
 
 Fact Sheet 
 
 CEQ’s Initial List of Actions  to enhance and modernize the environmental review and decision-making process was issued in September 2017.
 
 Fact Sheet 
 
 EO 13807 established a One Federal Decision policy for Federal environmental reviews of major infrastructure projects. The One Federal Decision policy sets a goal for completing environmental reviews for major infrastructure projects within 2 years. CEQ and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Permitting Council), developed a framework for implementing the One Federal Decision policy, and on April 9, 2018, 11 Federal agencies and the Permitting Council signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Under the MOU, agencies have committed to greater coordination throughout the process to achieve the 2 year goal, including through the development of joint project schedules, in order to provide greater transparency, accountability, and predictability for project sponsors, applicants, and the public. Implementation of the One Federal Decision policy: Framework Memorandum  (March 20, 2018) Memorandum of Understanding  (April 9, 2018)

 Water Reuse 
 
 Section 4 of the October 2018 Presidential Memorandum directed Federal agencies to improve use of technology to increase water reliability.  This included broader scale deployment of desalination technology, recycled water, and programs that promote and encourage innovation, research and development of technology that improve water management, and using best available science through real-time monitoring of wildlife and water deliveries. 
 Water reuse represents a major opportunity to support our nation’s communities and economy by bolstering safe and reliable water supplies for human consumption, agriculture, business, industry, recreation, and healthy ecosystems.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in conjunction with other Federal agencies including CEQ, announced a draft National Water Reuse Action plan for public comment in September 2019 and a final National Water Reuse Action Plan in February 2020.

For many infrastructure projects, the permitting process can be fragmented, inefficient, unpredictable, and costly.@@Recognizing these challenges, in August 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 13807, to reduce unnecessary duplication and uncertainty in the Federal environmental review and authorization process that can delay major infrastructure projects and hold back the American economy.@@EO 13807 established a One Federal Decision policy for Federal environmental reviews of major infrastructure projects. The One Federal Decision policy sets a goal for completing environmental reviews for major infrastructure projects within 2 years. CEQ and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Permitting Council), developed a framework for implementing the One Federal Decision policy, and on April 9, 2018, 11 Federal agencies and the Permitting Council signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Under the MOU, agencies have committed to greater coordination throughout the process to achieve the 2 year goal, including through the development of joint project schedules, in order to provide greater transparency, accountability, and predictability for project sponsors, applicants, and the public.@@The @@ tracks the Federal government’s environmental review and authorization processes for major infrastructure projects.@@To comply with section 5(d) of EO 13807, CEQ will refer various requests for designation of State projects pursuant to @@ to the Permitting Council, Department of Transportation, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as appropriate.

As outlined in its  National Drug Control Strategy ,  National Treatment Plan for Substance Use Disorder , and  National Drug Control Assessment ,  the Trump Administration seeks to save American lives by preventing drug use before it starts, providing evidence-based treatment and recovery support for those suffering from substance use disorder, and reducing the availability of illicit drugs in the United States. Prevention Preventing drug use requires practitioners to use evidence-based approaches to shift behaviors and develop community norms that discourage drug use. As the first line of effort in our strategy, ONDCP will support ongoing efforts to stop substance use before it starts by: Reducing the presence of unnecessary and unneeded prescription drugs by promoting safe prescribing practices, expanding the use of prescription drug monitoring programs, and expanding drug take-back programs; Empowering and supporting families, caregivers, and local communities as they address substance misuse; and Educating citizens and changing norms and behaviors around drug use by implementing a nationwide media campaign such as the  Truth about Opioids . Treatment and Recovery In 2018, only 11% of the estimated 21.3 million Americans who met the criteria for substance use disorder received treatment at a specialized facility. Research shows that this“treatment gap” is caused by a combination of a lack of access to effective treatment services and prevailing attitudes about addiction. The second line of effort in our strategy therefore seeks to expand high-quality treatment and recovery services by: Enhancing the quality of and eliminating barriers to evidence-based addiction treatment, and increasing the size of the addiction recovery workforce; Supporting those seeking long-term recovery through access to drug courts, employment opportunities, and peer support services; Removing the feelings of shame and judgement and reducing the stigma of addiction through a nationwide media campaign; and Improving the public’s response to overdose by distributing naloxone and educating citizens on life-saving measures. Reducing the Availability of Illicit Drugs Almost all of the illicit drugs consumed in this country are produced abroad and brought across our borders or delivered through our mail and commercial carriers. The third line of effort in the National Drug Control Strategy aims to stop the production of drugs abroad and prevent them from entering our country by: Disrupting, dismantling, and defeating drug trafficking organizations by working with foreign partners and enhancing cooperation among our domestic law enforcement agencies, including through the HIDTA program; Responding to constant changes in drug trafficking patterns, disrupting internet sales on the dark web, and better detecting and interdicting deliveries through the mail and express consignment companies; and Interdicting the flow of drugs across our physical borders and into the United States. In conjunction with the National Drug Control Strategy, ONDCP released the  National Interdiction Command and Control Plan , which outlines the Trump Administration’s interdiction strategy to reduce the availability of illicit drugs in the United States. Additionally, the Administration released two counternarcotics strategies, outlining priorities in stopping the flow of drugs along both the Southwest and Northern borders. The  Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy  aims to prevent drug trafficking along the almost 2,000-mile border that separates the United States and Mexico. The  Northern Border Counternarcotics Strategy  aims to prevent the illegal trafficking of drugs across the United States-Canada border with regard to our 5,225-mile shared border – the longest in the world between two countries.

 Press Release  
 
 February 25, 2020, in Washington, DC.
 
 Press Release 
 
 Further Background: The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed into law on January 1, 1970, requires Federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of proposed major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. NEPA’s requirements apply to a broad range of actions affecting the daily lives of Americans across the country. From the construction of roads, bridges, highways, transmission lines, conventional and renewable energy projects, broadband deployment, and water infrastructure to management of activities on Federal lands, such as grazing, forest management, and wildfire protection to environmental restoration and other projects. CEQ has not comprehensively updated its NEPA implementing regulations since 1978, more than four decades ago. Over time, the NEPA process has become increasingly complex and time consuming. CEQ has found that, on average, it takes Federal agencies  4 and half years  to complete environmental impact statements (EISs) under NEPA, and for some projects it takes much longer. Additionally, these statements can also be lengthy and exceed, on average,  600 pages . In 2017, President Trump issued  Executive Order (EO) 13807  which directed CEQ to review its existing NEPA regulations and modernize and accelerate the Federal environmental review and decision-making process. Timeline of CEQ’s NEPA Review:  September 14, 2017 – CEQ issued an Initial List of Action to implement EO 13807.
 
 CEQ’s Initial List of Actions 
 Fact Sheet 
 
 June 20, 2018 – CEQ issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) soliciting feedback on potential revisions to update and clarify its NEPA regulations.
 
 ANPRM: Update to the Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act 
 Fact Sheet 
 
 July 21, 2018 –  CEQ extended the ANPRM comment period . August 20, 2018 – The comment period concluded. CEQ received over  12,500 comments  in response to the ANPRM. October 11, 2019 – CEQ  submitted  a draft Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for interagency review. January 9, 2020 – CEQ  announced  a NPRM to modernize and clarify the regulations to facilitate a more efficient, effective, and timely NEPA review process. March 10, 2020 – The NPRM comment period concluded. CEQ Reports: On December 14, 2018, CEQ issued a report on the length of time Federal agencies spent to complete EISs under NEPA. CEQ found that over the past decade, the average time for agencies to complete an EIS was 4 and a half years. CEQ’s current guidance suggests that this process, even for complex projects, should not take more than one year. CEQ Report on EIS Timelines (2010-2017) Fact Sheet On July 22, 2019, CEQ issued a report on the average length, by page, of EISs. CEQ found that the average length of an EIS was over 600 pages. CEQ’s current regulations suggest EISs should normally be less than 150 pages and less than 300 pages for proposals of unusual scope or complexity. CEQ Report on the Length of EISs (2013-2017) Fact Sheet CEQ has also developed and published a comprehensive list of all Federal agencies’ categorical exclusions (CEs) under NEPA. CEs are actions that a Federal agency has determined do not have a significant impact on the environment. CEs are not exemptions from NEPA, but rather they are a form of NEPA review. List of Federal Agency CEs Fact Sheet Recent Guidance: On June 21, 2019, CEQ proposed guidance for agencies regarding the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions when evaluating proposed major Federal actions in accordance with NEPA. Draft NEPA Guidance on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Fact Sheet July 24, 2019 – CEQ  extended the comment period For further information on NEPA, visit  NEPA.gov .

Created in 1997, the DFC Program provides grants to community coalitions to strengthen the infrastructure among local partners to create and sustain a reduction in local youth substance use. Recognizing that local problems need local solutions, DFC-funded coalitions engage multiple sectors of the community and employ a variety of environmental strategies to address local substance use problems. DFCs involve local communities in finding solutions and also helps youth at risk for substance use recognize the majority of our Nation’s youth choose not to use substances. As demonstrated by independent evaluations, the DFC Support Program significantly reduces substance use amongst the target population. DFC Coalitions are made up of community leaders representing twelve sectors that organize to meet the local prevention needs of the youth and families in their communities. These twelve sectors are: Youth Parents Businesses Media School Youth-serving organizations Law enforcement Religious/fraternal organizations Civic and volunteer organizations Healthcare professionals State, Local, and Tribal governments Other organizations involved in reducing illicit substance use By funding these coalitions, the DFC Support program ensures communities adopt a balanced and comprehensive approach to reducing substance abuse in their neighborhoods. For more information about the DFCs’ work and successes, click  here . For FY 2019, ONDCP is awarding over 700 grants to community coalitions across the country in all 50 states.

 The recipient of the 2019 – 2021 Model Acts grant is the  Legislative Analysis and Public Policy Association  (LAPPA). With ONDCP funding, LAPPA conducts research and analysis on effective model laws, provides technical assistance to legislators, and drafts model legislation on current and emerging illicit drug issues. Through this initiative, state legislators nationwide have passed legislation to support greater access to naloxone, established processes by which emergency health service professionals refer overdose survivors to treatment services, increased recovery housing and other support services in colleges, and, in general, enhanced and promoted evidence-based substance use programming across the country.

The HIDTA program oversees 29 regional HIDTAs in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. With HIDTA presence in over 600 counties across the country, an estimated two-thirds of Americans live in a HIDTA-designated county. Each HIDTA is guided by an Executive Board that includes an equal number of regional Federal and non-Federal (state, local, and tribal) law enforcement leaders and is managed by an  Executive Director  who has previous experience in anti-drug law enforcement. Law enforcement officials interested in participating in the HIDTA program can click  here  for more information. For more information about the HIDTAs’ work and successes, click  here .

					 Contact 									 Council on Environmental Quality The Office of Federal Sustainability (OFS), housed within CEQ and led by the Federal Chief Sustainability Officer, works across Federal agencies, departments, and other White House components to ensure effective implementation and achievement of statutory requirements and Administration goals related to Federal energy and environmental performance. The Federal government manages more than 350,000 buildings, 600,000 vehicles, and $500 billion annually in purchased goods and services and is the largest consumer of energy in the Nation. By increasing the efficiency of Federal operations, Federal agencies cut waste, save taxpayer dollars, reduce impacts on the environment, and promote clean air, land, and water. On May 17, 2018, President Trump issued  Executive Order (EO) 13834, titled “Efficient Federal Operations,”  which directs the heads of Federal agencies to manage their buildings, vehicles, and operations in a manner that increases efficiency, optimizes performance, eliminates unnecessary use of resources and protects the environment. EO 13834 sets forth goals for agencies to: (i) achieve and maintain annual reductions in building energy use; (ii) meet statutory requirements relating to the consumption of renewable energy and electricity; (iii) reduce potable and non-potable water consumption; (iv) utilize performance contracting to achieve energy, water, and building modernization, and infrastructure goals; (v) ensure new construction and major renovations conform to applicable building energy efficiency requirements and sustainable design principles, consider building efficiency when renewing or entering into leases, implement space utilization and optimization practices, and annually assess and report on building conformance to sustainability metrics; (vi) implement waste prevention and recycling measures; (vii) acquire, use and dispose of products and services, including electronics, in accordance with statutory mandates for purchasing preference; and (viii) track and report on energy management activities, performance improvements, cost reductions, greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water savings and other performance measures regarding sustainable management of Federal facilities, vehicle fleets, and operations. EO 13834, titled, “Efficient Federal Operations”

With approximately one out of every ten dollars of Federal government spending going to contractors, it is imperative that contract actions result in the best value for the taxpayer. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) in the Office of Management and Budget plays a central role in shaping the policies and practices federal agencies use to acquire the goods and services they need to carry out their responsibilities. OFPP was established by Congress in 1974 to provide overall direction for government-wide procurement policies, regulations and procedures and to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in acquisition processes. OFPP is headed by an Administrator who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Circulars

The CAS Board is an independent statutorily-established Board (41 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) consisting of five members: the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, who serves as the chairman, and four members with experience in Government contract cost accounting, two from the Federal government (DOD and GSA), one from industry, and one from the accounting profession. The Board’s regulations are codified at 48 CFR, Chapter 99. The standards are mandatory for use by all executive agencies and by contractors and subcontractors in estimating, accumulating, and reporting costs in connection with pricing and administration of, and settlement of disputes concerning, all covered negotiated prime contract and subcontract procurements with the United States Government. Covered contracts and subcontracts are those in excess of $750,000, provided that, at the time of award, the contractor or subcontractor is performing any CAS-covered contracts or subcontracts valued at $7.5 million or greater. As a result of changes made by section 811 the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2018, the $750,000 threshold will be raised to $2 million for contracts awarded after June 30, 2018.

With approximately one out of every ten dollars of Federal government spending going to contractors, it is imperative that contract actions result in the best value for the taxpayer.@@The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) in the Office of Management and Budget plays a central role in shaping the policies and practices federal agencies use to acquire the goods and services they need to carry out their responsibilities. OFPP was established by Congress in 1974 to provide overall direction for government-wide procurement policies, regulations and procedures and to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in acquisition processes. OFPP is headed by an Administrator who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.@@

@@The Cost Accounting Standards Board (CAS Board) has the exclusive authority to make, promulgate, and amend standards and interpretations designed to achieve uniformity and consistency in the cost accounting practices governing the measurement, assignment, and allocation of costs to contracts with the United States Government. The CAS Board is an independent statutorily-established Board (41 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) consisting of five members: the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, who serves as the chairman, and four members with experience in Government contract cost accounting, two from the Federal government (DOD and GSA), one from industry, and one from the accounting profession.@@The Board’s regulations are codified at 48 CFR, Chapter 99. The standards are mandatory for use by all executive agencies and by contractors and subcontractors in estimating, accumulating, and reporting costs in connection with pricing and administration of, and settlement of disputes concerning, all covered negotiated prime contract and subcontract procurements with the United States Government. Covered contracts and subcontracts are those in excess of $750,000, provided that, at the time of award, the contractor or subcontractor is performing any CAS-covered contracts or subcontracts valued at $7.5 million or greater. As a result of changes made by section 811 the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2018, the $750,000 threshold will be raised to $2 million for contracts awarded after June 30, 2018.@@The FAIR Act (31 U.S.C. 501 note) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 require executive agencies, with certain exceptions, to prepare inventories of the commercial and inherently governmental activities performed by their federal employees.

Senior Economists have a Ph.D. in economics and are typically on leave from positions at universities, government agencies, or research organizations. Excellent research skills and strong presentation skills are needed. Senior Economists participate actively in the policy process, represent the CEA in interagency meetings, and have primary responsibility for the economic analysis and reports prepared by the Council. In recent years, Senior Economists have been faculty members from institutions such as Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Duke, Georgetown, Maryland, Michigan, MIT, and Yale, and economists from the Federal Reserve Board, USDA, SEC, and the DOJ. It has been a productive and collegial team, and it is supported by an exceptionally strong staff of on-leave PhD students and recent college graduates. The CEA needs specialists in virtually every field of economics. Most Senior Economists begin work at the Council in the summer and stay for a full academic year. CEA staff members must be U.S. citizens and may not also be citizens of another country.

For nearly four decades, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has provided an important means through which the public can obtain information regarding the activities of Federal agencies. Under the FOIA, the public can obtain records from any Federal agency, subject to the exemptions enacted by the Congress to protect information that must be held in confidence for the Government to function effectively or for other purposes.” The Freedom of Information Act ( 5 U.S.C. § 552 ), provides a right of access to the public of government records. The Act also allows the government to withhold certain information in responding to those requests in 9 exemptions, including for national security, deliberative process and attorney client, and confidential business information, to name a few. Back to Top About OMB: What does OMB do? What offices does OMB have? What types of records does OMB have?  About FOIA and how to submit a request: What does FOIA do? May I ask a question under the FOIA? How do I submit a FOIA request? What are the reasons for not releasing a record requested under a FOIA?

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is an agency within the Executive Office of the President. OMB assists the President in the discharge of his budgetary, management, and other executive responsibilities. More specifically, OMB assists the President in the preparation of the Federal budget and in managing its execution by the agencies. OMB works to assure that proposed legislation (as well as testimony, reports and policies) is consistent with Administration policies, including the President’s Budget. OMB also has a central role in providing leadership in the development, oversight and coordination of the Federal government’s policies in procurement, financial management and the information, statistical, and regulatory arenas as well as in the implementation of those policies. OMB promotes better program management, strengthens administrative management, develops agency-performance measures and improves coordination of the Executive Branch’s various operations.

 Back to FAQs 
 What does FOIA do?  As noted above, FOIA provides a right of access to the public of government records. The Act also allows the government to withhold certain information in responding to those requests in 9 exemptions, including for national security, deliberative process and attorney client, and confidential business information, to name a few. 
 Back to FAQs 
 May I ask a question under the FOIA?  Please be aware that FOIA does not require agencies to do research, analyze data, answer written questions, or to create records in order to respond to a request.It is also important to understand that there is no central office in the government which processes FOIA requests for all agencies; each Federal agency responds to FOIA requests for records in its own files. Thus, the public may submit FOIA requests to OMB to obtain records that are in OMB’s files. 
 Back to FAQs 
 How do I submit a FOIA request?  Individuals wishing to file a FOIA request must write a letter to submit a FOIA request. Address your letter to:
 Dionne Hardy, FOIA Officer 
Office of Management and Budget 
725 17th Street NW, Suite 9204 
Washington, DC 20503 
E-mail address: OMBFOIA@omb.eop.gov 
 Please note that for security reasons, OMB’s receipt and processing of mail may be delayed. Therefore, you may also fax your letter to: 202.395.3504. 
 You should be as specific as possible in your request for records (see below for  records you can receive without submitting a FOIA request ). Please describe the specific records you are requesting in sufficient detail so that the records can be located with a reasonable amount of effort. You should also consult  OMB’s FOIA regulations , which outline the procedures governing the FOIA request process. 
 Upon receipt of a FOIA request, the FOIA Officer will determine within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such request whether it is appropriate to grant the request. (Please be aware that the time period for providing a response may be extended under the FOIA.) OMB will provide a written response to the FOIA request; if the request is denied in whole or in part, OMB will notify the requester of the denial, and of the requester’s right to file an appeal within OMB. If OMB denies an appeal in whole or in part, the requester may seek judicial review of that denial. 
 Back to FAQs 
 What are the reasons for not releasing a record requested under the FOIA?  The FOIA statute provided reasons why an agency may not release a requested record. Such records are considered to be legally exempt from release. Among the reasons for withholding a document are the following exemptions from disclosure:
 Exemption (b)(1) National Security 
Exemption (b)(2) Internal Documents 
Exemption (b)(3) Statutory withholding 
Exemption (b)(4) Commercial or proprietary data 
Exemption (b)(5) Predecisional, deliberative communications 
Exemption (b)(6) Privacy 
Exemption (b)(7) Law enforcement 
Exemption (b)(8) Financial institutions 
Exemption (b)(9) Geological information 
 Back to FAQs 
 Do I need to submit a particular form to request documents under FOIA?  No. However, in order to process your request, you need to reasonably describe the records you are looking for, providing as much information as possible (in order for OMB to search for them). OMB may also contact you to request that you provide more detail. 
 Back to FAQs 
 Is there a fee to submit a FOIA request?  OMB, like other agencies, may charge a fee for responding to your FOIA request. The amount of fee depends on who you are and why you are making a FOIA request. The FOIA Act divides requesters into four categories for fees, as described below. In addition, in certain circumstances, OMB may request advance payment of fees. You may also indicate, in your letter, how much in fees you are willing to pay, before OMB needs to contact you.
 
 Commercial use requesters . When OMB receives a request for documents for commercial use, it will assess charges that recover the full direct cost of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. 
 Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requests . OMB shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. 
 Representatives of the news media . OMB shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. 
 All other requesters.  OMB shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees that recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. 
 
 OMB may waive fees, in whole or in part, if “disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” If you wish to request a waiver of fees, please provide as much information as possible about how you will be using the information in order for OMB to make its determination. 
 Please note that in certain circumstances, such as when fees exceed $250 OMB may contact a requester for the advance payment of fees by check or money order payable to the U.S. Treasury. 
 Back to FAQs 
 How long will it take to receive an answer to my FOIA request?  The FOIA Act gives OMB a minimum of 20 working days (that’s excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) to respond to your request. OMB can also extend that time period an additional 10 working days (OMB will send you a letter when that occurs). As noted above, due to security reasons, OMB’s receipt and processing of mail could be delayed; the 20-day time period only begins when OMB has received your letter. 
 Back to FAQs 
 What will I receive in response to my FOIA request?  OMB will send you a letter responding to your FOIA request. If we have located records in response to your request, our letter will tell you that. If we have located records, but have withheld any part of them, our letter will tell you of your right to file an appeal within OMB (see below for  how to file an appeal ). If OMB denies an appeal in whole or in part, the requester may seek judicial review of that denial. 
 Back to FAQs 
 What if I have concerns about the processing of my FOIA request?  OMB has a FOIA Requester Service Center. You can call the FOIA Requester Service Center at: (202) 395-FOIA (3642). The FOIA Requester Service Center is available to assist you in answering questions that you have about your request. If you are not satisfied with the assistance you receive from the FOIA Requester Service Center or they cannot assist you, you may also leave a message for OMB’s Public Liaison: (202) 395-FOIA (3642). 
 Back to FAQs 
 May I ask for my request to be expedited?  OMB’s regulations provide for how someone can request expedited processing. Generally, you can request expedited processing if you demonstrate in your request letter to OMB one of the following:
 
 Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; 
 An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information; 
 The loss of substantial due process rights; or 
 A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government’s integrity which effect public confidence. 
 
 OMB will respond to your request for expedited processing within 10 working days. At the present time, OMB does not have multi-track processing (which means that OMB staff works on requests as they come in; there is not a first-in-first-out queue that your request comes in).  What if I have concerns about the response I receive to my FOIA request?  As noted above, OMB has a FOIA Requester Service Center. You can call the FOIA Requester Service Center at: (202) 395-FOIA (3642). The FOIA Requester Service Center is also available to assist you in answering questions that you have about OMB’s response to your request. If you are not satisfied with the assistance you receive from the FOIA Requester Service Center or they cannot assist you, you may also leave a message for OMB’s Public Liaison: (202) 395-FOIA (3642). 
 Back to FAQs 
  How do I appeal OMB’s response to my FOIA request?  Send your appeal, in another letter, to the same address as before:
 Dionne Hardy, FOIA Officer 
Office of Management and Budget, 
725 17th Street NW, Suite 9204 
Washington, DC 20503 
E-mail address: OMBFOIA@omb.eop.gov 
 Please note that for security reasons, OMB’s receipt and processing of mail may be delayed. Therefore, you may also fax your letter to: (202) 395-FOIA (3642). 
 Although it is not required, it is helpful to OMB in processing your appeal request if you include a copy of your original request letter as well as OMB’s response. 
 Back to FAQs 
 When will I hear back on my appeal?  The FOIA Act gives OMB a minimum of 20 working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) to respond to your appeal request. OMB can also extend that time period an additional 10 working days (OMB will send you a letter when that occurs). As noted above, due to security reasons, OMB’s receipt and processing of mail could be delayed; the 20-day time period only begins when OMB has received your letter. 
 Back to FAQs 
  Are there records that OMB has that I can look at (inspect), without filing a FOIA request?  OMB makes available in its Public Reading Room and in the Regulatory/Paperwork Records Management Center information pertaining to matters issued, adopted, or promulgated by OMB; these are commonly known as “reading room materials.” These materials include the Federal Budget, OMB Circulars, selected OMB Bulletins, regulations and information collections reviewed by OMB, other policies and management documents, and OMB’s Annual FOIA Report. Many of these documents are also available through OMB’s Internet Home Page. Visitors to the public reading area must write or telephone ahead (see below for details) to make an appointment. Security in the New Executive Office Building prevents visitors from entering the building without an appointment.
 
 OMB’s Public Reading Room: OMB’s public reading area is located in the Executive Office of the President Library, Room G-102, New Executive Office Building, 725 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-FOIA (3642). 
 
 Many of OMB’s documents are available to the public without having to make a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. These documents are called “proactive disclosures” because they are proactively posted online. Documents which are disclosed in the interest of transparency and documents which have been requested frequently under FOIA are provided below.

					 Documents and Reports 									 Office of Science and Technology Policy The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) is the principal means within the Executive Branch to coordinate science and technology (S&T) policy across the diverse entities that make up the Federal research and development enterprise. The NSTC convenes Federal S&T leaders and establishes clear national goals for science and technology policy and investment. The Council prepares research and development strategies that are coordinated across Federal agencies aimed at accomplishing multiple national goals. The work of the NSTC is organized under six primary committees: S&T Enterprise, Environment, Homeland and National Security, Science, STEM Education, and Technology. It also includes two special committees: The Select Committee on AI and the Joint Committee on Research Environments. Each of these committees oversees subcommittees and working groups focused on different aspects of science and technology and working to coordinate across the federal government. This Cabinet-level Council is chaired by the President, the membership of the NSTC is made up of the Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries and Agency Heads with significant science and technology responsibilities, and other White House officials. In practice, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) oversees the NSTC’s ongoing activities. The NSTC was established by  Executive Order  on November 23, 1993.

					 Contact 									 Council on Environmental Quality Welcome to the Council on Environmental Quality’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requester Service Center. This center was created in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and Executive Order 13392, “Improving Agency Disclosure of Information,” which directs Federal agencies to ensure citizen-centered, results-oriented FOIA operations. The center provides basic instruction on obtaining CEQ information under FOIA, and the Proactive Disclosure Reading Room makes available documents on environmental issues. To save time and money, please review the material available on CEQ’s website before submitting a FOIA request Please state clearly that the request is being made under FOIA. Be as specific as you can when identifying the information you are seeking, and include your name, address, and contact information to enable us to contact you with any questions. Remember:  FOIA requests and responses may be made available for public inspection, so don’t submit information involving trade secrets, confidential or proprietary commercial or financial information, or any other material you do not want to be publicly available. Submit requests electronically to efoia@ceq.eop.gov. Fax them to (202) 456-0753 or address regular mail to Freedom of Information Officer, Council on Environmental Quality, 730 Jackson Place, NW, Washington, DC 20503.
