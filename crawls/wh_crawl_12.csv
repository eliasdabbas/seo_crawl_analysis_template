					 Artificial Intelligence for the American People 01 02 03 04 05 The age of artificial intelligence (AI) has arrived, and is transforming everything from healthcare to transportation to manufacturing. America has long been the global leader in this new era of AI, and is poised to maintain this leadership going forward because of our strong innovation ecosystem. Realizing the full potential of AI for the Nation requires the combined efforts of industry, academia, and government. The Administration has been active in developing policies and implementing strategies that accelerate AI innovation in the U.S. for the benefit of the American people. These activities align with several areas of emphasis: AI for American Innovation, AI for American Industry, AI for the American Worker, and AI with American Values. This AI.gov website provides a portal for exploring these activities in more depth, and serves as a resource for those who want to learn more about how to take full advantage of the opportunities of AI. “Continued American leadership in Artificial Intelligence is of paramount importance to maintaining the economic and national security of the United States.”

					 Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative Pillars 1 Women Prospering in the Workforce 2 Women Succeeding as Entrepreneurs 3 Women Enabled in the Economy When women are economically empowered, they re-invest in their families and communities, producing a multiplier effect that spurs economic growth and contributes to global peace and stability. In February 2019, President Trump established the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative, also led and created by Advisor to the President, Ivanka Trump. This initiative is the first whole-of-government effort to advance global women’s economic empowerment. W-GDP seeks to reach 50 million women in the developing world by 2025 through U.S. government activities, private-public partnerships, and a new, innovative W-GDP Fund. In its first year, W-GDP reached 12 million women worldwide.  The W-GDP Initiative aims to enhance opportunities for women to participate meaningfully in the economy and advance both prosperity and national security. W-GDP focuses on three pillars: Women Prospering in the Workforce, Women Succeeding as Entrepreneurs, and Women Enabled in the Economy. 2 Increase the access of women entrepreneurs and business owners to financing, market opportunities, and training to establish and grow their businesses. Women entrepreneurs are a growing market force, serving as a critical source of innovation and job creation and fueling economic growth. However, women-owned businesses do not have equal access to the capital needed to stabilize or expand. There is a roughly $300 billion credit gap for women-owned small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) globally. In many countries, immature or underdeveloped financial systems do not adequately serve the “missing middle,” such as women-owned SMEs that have financial needs beyond micro-finance and whose assets do not qualify them for larger commercial loans. Solving this problem requires not only long-term, systemic reforms, but also short-term financial mechanisms that can address immediate needs. Few financial intermediaries are able to address these short-term needs without some form of external assistance. Women entrepreneurs in the developing world also lack access to markets, market information, digital and personal services, networks, mentorship, and other resources that enable them to overcome the obstacles of starting and growing firms as well as connecting with buyers. As with finance, some of these barriers are systemic, and others are more individualized. Systemic barriers require institutional reforms. Individualized solutions require development of public and private sector partnerships that can provide the training or assistance needed, including, in some cases, to help organize and formalize individual women entrepreneurs into cooperatives to achieve economies of scale. Women’s economic empowerment and equality exist when women entrepreneurs enjoy equal access to the same affordable financing mechanisms that men do, including both credit and equity, as well as equal access to markets, market information, digital technology, and services. Investing in women is vital for our collective economic prosperity and global stability. When we empower women, communities prosper and countries thrive. Societies that empower women to participate fully in civic and economic life are more prosperous and peaceful. White House Logo

					 Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative Pillars 1 Women Prospering in the Workforce 2 Women Succeeding as Entrepreneurs 3 Women Enabled in the Economy When women are economically empowered, they re-invest in their families and communities, producing a multiplier effect that spurs economic growth and contributes to global peace and stability. In February 2019, President Trump established the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative, also led and created by Advisor to the President, Ivanka Trump. This initiative is the first whole-of-government effort to advance global women’s economic empowerment. W-GDP seeks to reach 50 million women in the developing world by 2025 through U.S. government activities, private-public partnerships, and a new, innovative W-GDP Fund. In its first year, W-GDP reached 12 million women worldwide.  The W-GDP Initiative aims to enhance opportunities for women to participate meaningfully in the economy and advance both prosperity and national security. W-GDP focuses on three pillars: Women Prospering in the Workforce, Women Succeeding as Entrepreneurs, and Women Enabled in the Economy. 2X is focused on providing women in the developing world access to finance, jobs, and services that enhance economic opportunity. INVEST IN WOMEN. INVEST IN THE WORLD. Mobilizing more than $1 billion globally. The Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative was announced at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in July 2017 and launched in October 2017 at the World Bank. We-Fi is an unprecedented opportunity to harness the public and private sectors to open new doors for women entrepreneurs across the developing world.  Today, 1.7 billion women in low- and middle-income countries still do not own mobile phones. Advancing women’s digital connectivity is key to promoting their empowerment in an increasingly digital world. WomenConnect Challenge seeks to bridge the gender digital divide so that women can fully participate in the global economy. The International Visitor Leadership Program, or IVLP, will bring participants from around the world to the United States to examine best practices for reducing restrictive legal, regulatory, and cultural barriers to women’s full and free participation in the economy. Societies that empower women to participate fully in civic and economic life are more prosperous and peaceful. White House Logo

					 Contents 1 Unleashing Economic Potential 2 Empowering the Palestinian People 3 Enhancing Palestinian Governance Generations of Palestinians have lived without knowing peace, and the West Bank and Gaza have fallen into a protracted crisis. Yet the Palestinian story will not end here. The Palestinian people continue their historic endeavor to realize their aspirations and build a better future for their children. With the potential to facilitate more than $50 billion in new investment over ten years,  Peace to Prosperity  represents the most ambitious and comprehensive international effort for the Palestinian people to date. It has the ability to fundamentally transform the West Bank and Gaza and to open a new chapter in Palestinian history—one defined, not by adversity and loss, but by freedom and dignity. These three initiatives are more than just a vision of a promising future for the Palestinian people—they are also the foundation for an achievable plan. If implemented,  Peace to Prosperity  will empower the Palestinian people to build the society that they have aspired to establish for generations. With the support of the international community, this vision is within reach. Ultimately, however, the power to unlock it lies in the hands of the Palestinian people. Only through peace can the Palestinians achieve prosperity.

					 1 Unleashing Economic Potential 2 Empowering the Palestinian People 3 Enhancing Palestinian Governance Peace to Prosperity  will establish a new foundation for the Palestinian economy, generating rapid economic growth and job creation. This part of the plan will create a business environment that provides investors with confidence that their assets will be secure by improving property rights, the rule of law, fiscal sustainability, capital markets, and anti-corruption policies. The plan will reduce constraints on Palestinian economic growth by  Opening the West Bank and Gaza  to regional and global markets. Major investments in transportation and infrastructure will help the West Bank and Gaza integrate with neighboring economies, increasing the competitiveness of Palestinian exports and reducing the complications of transport and travel. To complement these investments, this plan will also support steps to improve Palestinian cooperation with Egypt, Israel, and Jordan, with the goal of reducing regulatory barriers to the movement of Palestinian goods and people. Essential infrastructure is needed for the Palestinian people and their businesses to flourish. This plan will facilitate billions of dollars of investment in the electricity, water, and telecommunications sectors, increasing generation capacity while creating efficient transmission and distribution networks. The applicable authorities will receive training and assistance to manage this infrastructure and to increase competition to keep costs low for consumers. Following the adoption of key policy reforms and the construction of essential infrastructure,  Peace to Prosperity  envisions extraordinary private-sector investment in entrepreneurship, small businesses, tourism, agriculture, housing, manufacturing, and natural resources. The goal of early-stage investment will be to remove constraints to growth and to target key projects that build momentum, generate jobs, and increase gross domestic product (GDP). From the father working in his shop to support his family, to the young college graduate building her first company, Palestinians working throughout the private sector will benefit from this plan. A lasting peace agreement will ensure a future of economic opportunity for all Palestinians. Peace to Prosperity  encourages  Strengthening Regional Development and Integration , creates new opportunities for Palestinian businesses, and increases commerce with neighboring countries. This vision will boost the economies of Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon and reduce trade barriers across the region. Increased cooperation between trading partners will support companies in these countries, which are seeking to develop international business, particularly in the West Bank and Gaza. The plan will help the Palestinian private sector capitalize on growth opportunities by improving access to strong, neighboring economies. 1 Peace to Prosperity  will establish a new foundation for the Palestinian economy, generating rapid economic growth and job creation.

					 1 Unleashing Economic Potential 2 Empowering the Palestinian People 3 Enhancing Palestinian Governance Peace to Prosperity  will unlock the vast potential of the Palestinian people by empowering them to pursue their goals and ambitions. This part of the vision will support the Palestinian people through education, workforce development,  and an improved quality of life. Enhancing the Quality of the Education System  in the West Bank and Gaza will ensure no Palestinian is disadvantaged by inadequate educational opportunity. This vision supports the development and training of Palestinian educators while expanding access to educational opportunities to underserved communities and demographics. Other projects will help encourage educational reforms and innovation. By providing financial incentives to support the development of improved academic standards and curricula, this plan will help turn the West Bank and Gaza into a center of educational excellence. Peace to Prosperity  will  Strengthen Workforce Development Programs , reducing unemployment rates and increasing the occupational mobility of the Palestinian workforce. By supporting apprenticeships, career counseling, and job placement services, this vision will help ensure Palestinian youth are fully prepared to enter the job market and achieve their professional goals. Additional projects will help employed workers receive the training they need to enhance their skills or change careers. Ultimately, this plan will ensure that all Palestinians have access to the tools they need to compete in the global economy and take full advantage of the opportunities offered by this vision. Peace to Prosperity  will provide new resources and incentives to  Transform the Palestinian  Healthcare Sector  and ensure the Palestinian people have access to the care they need within  the West Bank and Gaza. This vision will rapidly increase the capacity of Palestinian hospitals by ensuring that they have the supplies, medicines, vaccines, and equipment to provide top-quality care and protect against health emergencies. Other funds will help improve services and standards in Palestinian healthcare facilities. Through targeted investments in new facilities, educational opportunities for medical staff and aspiring healthcare professionals, and public awareness campaigns to improve preventative care, the plan will significantly improve health outcomes throughout the West Bank and Gaza. Peace to Prosperity  will support projects that  Improve the Quality of Life  for the Palestinian people. From investments in new cultural institutions to financial support for Palestinian artists and musicians, the plan will help the next generation of Palestinians explore their creativity and hone their talents. It will also support improved municipal services and the development of new public spaces across the West Bank and Gaza. These developments will help turn the West Bank and Gaza into a cultural and recreational center to the benefit of all Palestinians. 2 Peace to Prosperity  will unlock the vast potential of the Palestinian people by empowering them to pursue their goals and ambitions.

					 1 Unleashing Economic Potential 2 Empowering the Palestinian People 3 Enhancing Palestinian Governance While implementing  Peace to Prosperity  will require significant international support, no vision for the Palestinians can be realized without the full support of the Palestinian people and their leadership. Peace to Prosperity  encourages the Palestinian public sector to provide the services and administration necessary for the Palestinian people to have a better future. If the government realizes its potential by investing in its people and adopting the foundational elements identified in this plan, job growth will ensue and the Palestinian people and their economy will thrive. This vision establishes a path that, in partnership with the Palestinian public sector, will enable prosperity. The strategy for reform will help the Palestinian public sector  Transform the Business Environment  by improving private property rights; safeguards against corruption; access to credit; functioning capital markets along with pro-growth policies and regulations; and certainty and predictability for investors that result in economic growth, private-sector job creation, and increased exports and foreign direct investment. Just as the Japanese, South Korean, and Singaporean governments rose to meet the daunting challenges their societies faced at critical times in their respective histories, so too can the Palestinian leadership chart a new course for its people. The plan identifies and addresses the requirements for developing human capital, igniting innovation, creating and growing small and medium businesses, and attracting international companies that will invest in the future of the West Bank and Gaza. Building the Institutions  of the Palestinian public sector and enhancing government responsiveness to the people is critical. Through this plan, government attention will be directed to increase judicial independence and grow civil society organizations. A stronger court system will better protect and secure the rights and property of the citizens. More government transparency will help foster trust from Palestinians—and outside investors—that court decisions are made fairly, contracts are awarded and enforced honestly, and business investments are safe. Peace to Prosperity  will  Improve Government Operations  and the provision of services to the Palestinian people. In line with successful private-sector models, the Palestinian public sector must strive to be fiscally stable, financially independent, caring to its workers, and efficient in providing services to its citizens. The vision will work to eliminate public-sector arrears and implement a budgeting and tax plan that promotes long-term fiscal sustainability, without the need for budget support or donor funds. It will also assist with the adoption of new technologies that can provide Palestinian citizens the ability to directly request and access government support and services. The plan will offer new training and opportunities for civil servants to improve their productivity, help prepare them to meet governance challenges, and make it easier for them to perform their jobs. And, finally, this vision aims to provide government services at low cost and high-efficiency, which will facilitate private-sector growth. 3 While implementing  Peace to Prosperity  will require significant international support, no vision for the Palestinians can be realized without the full support of the Palestinian people and their leadership.

					 Artificial Intelligence for the American People 01 02 03 04 05 The age of artificial intelligence (AI) has arrived, and is transforming everything from healthcare to transportation to manufacturing. America has long been the global leader in this new era of AI, and is poised to maintain this leadership going forward because of our strong innovation ecosystem. Realizing the full potential of AI for the Nation requires the combined efforts of industry, academia, and government. The Administration has been active in developing policies and implementing strategies that accelerate AI innovation in the U.S. for the benefit of the American people. These activities align with several areas of emphasis: AI for American Innovation, AI for American Industry, AI for the American Worker, and AI with American Values. This AI.gov website provides a portal for exploring these activities in more depth, and serves as a resource for those who want to learn more about how to take full advantage of the opportunities of AI. “Continued American leadership in Artificial Intelligence is of paramount importance to maintaining the economic and national security of the United States.” 
 – President Donald J. Trump 05

					 The United States has long been a champion and defender of the core values of freedom, guarantees of human rights, the rule of law, stability in our institutions, rights to privacy, respect for intellectual property, and opportunities to all to pursue their dreams. The AI technologies we develop must also reflect these fundamental American values and our devotion to helping people. Our goal is to ensure that AI technologies are understandable, trustworthy, robust, and safe. In addition, the broader impacts of AI on society must be considered, including implications for the workforce and assurances that AI will be developed responsibly. The United States is actively addressing these challenges through R&D programs and engagement with the broad stakeholder communities, including international discussions on AI development. As part of the American AI Initiative, Federal agencies will foster public trust in AI systems by establishing guidance for AI development and use across different types of technology and industrial sectors. In addition to the national strategy, the White House in January 2020  proposed  guidance for the regulation of AI applications, which will help Federal regulatory agencies develop and maintain approaches for the safe and trustworthy creation and adoption of new AI technologies without stifling innovation. As new AI technologies are created, we must also increase our understanding of how AI systems derive solutions, and why they make the decisions they make. An important R&D emphasis is on providing AI with explainability mechanisms that help human users understand reasons for AI outputs. DARPA’s  Explainable AI (XAI) program  aims to create machine learning techniques that produce more explainable solutions while maintaining high performance and appropriate levels of trust in the system. NSF’s  Program on Fairness in Artificial Intelligence in Collaboration with Amazon   will fund research on fairness in AI, with the goal of contributing to trustworthy AI systems that are readily accepted and deployed to tackle grand challenges facing society. The complexity of many AI systems creates important safety and security challenges that must be addressed to ensure that these systems are trustworthy. In particular, AI systems have some inherent cybersecurity risks because of the characteristics of how the technology is designed. R&D investments such as  DARPA’s AI Next Campaign  will create solutions for countering adversarial attacks on AI technologies, such as those that attempt to contaminate training data, modify algorithms, create adversarial inputs, or exploit flaws in AI system goals. This research is expected to lead to more secure, robust, and safe AI systems that are reliable and trustworthy. Rapid progress in the development of AI technologies has many potential benefits, including the creation of new industries and occupations, increased opportunities for innovation, and increased productivity. However, these technologies are changing the nature of work, and have caused some concerns about the possibility of lost jobs, or the mismatch between available occupations and the skills of the workforce. Our strategy for AI and the American Worker provides educational and training opportunities that help the workforce thrive in the new economy. Beyond the immediate educational need, however, is the need to look forward to better understand the changing landscape of jobs and work. NSF is responding to this need by focusing R&D on convergent research on  The Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier . This research will help us better understand the human-technology partnership and the emerging socio-technological landscape, create new technologies to augment human performance, and foster livelong and pervasive learning with technology. The Trump Administration is committed to promoting an international environment that supports AI R&D and opens markets for American AI industries while also ensuring that the technology is developed in a manner consistent with our Nation’s values and interests. The United States supports international AI collaborations and partnerships that are grounded in evidence-based approaches, analytical research, and multi-stakeholder engagements that bring different perspectives together. The United States is leading in a number of international activities that promote trust in and adoption of AI technologies. In May 2019, the United States joined with other OECD countries to advance common AI principles, outlined in the  Recommendation on AI . This recommendation formalizes principles for the innovative and trustworthy development and application of AI, marking the first time that the United States and like-minded democracies have committed to common AI principles. These principles reflect many of the priorities championed by the American AI Initiative – priorities like removing barriers to innovation and discovery, prioritizing long-term R&D, building the AI workforce, and fostering public trust. In June 2019, the  G20 also adopted these principles , expanding their impact around the world. In 2018, OSTP led the U.S. delegation to the 2018 G7 Innovation Ministerial, which resulted in a joint  Statement on Artificial Intelligence , recognizing  “the interconnected relationship between supporting economic growth from AI innovation; increasing trust in and adoption of AI; and promoting inclusivity in AI development and deployment.” In 2017, OSTP also led the US delegation to the G7 “ICT and Industry Ministerial”, which resulted in an  outcome document on AI  that recognizes that  “the rapid advancement of AI technologies has the potential to bring immense benefits to our economies and societies”. It further acknowledges “that advancing artificial intelligence technologies is not only a matter of overcoming technical challenges. It is also a matter of understanding the broader potential effects of these technologies on society and our economies and of ensuring that we advance these technologies with a human-centric approach in harmony with our laws, our policies and our values.” “For the first time in history, America and likeminded democracies of the world will commit to common AI principles reflecting our shared values and priorities. These principles send a strong message: The OECD countries stand together in unleashing AI innovation, understanding that it is an essential tool to drive economic growth, empower workers, and lift up quality of life for all.”

					 America’s decades-long leadership in AI research and development has resulted in cutting-edge, transformative technologies that are improving lives, growing innovative industries, empowering workers, and increasing national security. These successes are the result of a strong, long-term emphasis on visionary, competitive, and high-payoff fundamental research programs that advance the frontiers of AI. American R&D investments in AI are measured not only by the amount of our financial investment, but also in the quality and impact of the results. These AI investments continue to emphasize the broad spectrum of challenges in AI, including core AI research, use-inspired and applied AI R&D, computer systems research in support of AI, and cyberinfrastructure and datasets needed for AI. Cross-disciplinary AI investments focus on the wide range of applications of importance to the nation, including science, medicine, communication, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and security. AI investments are prioritized in agency budgets and coordinated across the Federal government to leverage the efficiencies of shared interests, while also identifying and filling gaps in our investment portfolios. Our approach strengthens and leverages the unique and vibrant American R&D ecosystem, combining the strengths of government, academia, and industry. Special emphasis is placed on innovative public-private partnerships that accelerate AI discoveries. The result is a thriving R&D enterprise that maintains American leadership in AI technologies. “Federal contributions in early-stage R&D can help lay the technical and scientific foundation for truly revolutionary new technologies, particularly those that require sustained support before becoming attractive for private sector investment. The President’s 2020 Budget prioritizes investments for four key Industries of the Future: artificial intelligence, quantum information sciences, advanced communication networks (including fifth generation networks and beyond), and advanced manufacturing.” 2020 Budget – Analytical Perspectives R&D Chapter “Advances in AI are crucial for the U.S. science and engineering enterprise, and nearly all sectors of our 21st-century economy. Many of the transformative uses of AI that we are witnessing today are founded in federal government investments in fundamental AI research that reach back over decades. Building the foundations of tomorrow’s AI innovations will require new interdisciplinary collaborations, resources, and strategic vision – principles that NSF has championed in its support of fundamental AI research.” – Dr. France Córdova, Director, National Science Foundation. “The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) invests in high-risk, high-payoff research programs that have the potential to provide our nation with an overwhelming intelligence advantage. The world is increasingly complex and full of data, and we have reached a point where there aren’t enough humans to sort through the data and make the complex simple. AI provides us with the critical capabilities needed to handle this big, complex world and to achieve an intelligence advantage.” – Dr. Stacey Dixon, Director, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity “Continued leadership in AI, quantum information science (QIS), and strategic computing is critically important to our national security and economic competitiveness. Advances in these areas promise opportunities for major scientific breakthroughs and are quickly transforming American life and industry. Agencies should invest in fundamental and applied AI research, including machine learning, autonomous systems, and applications at the human-technology frontier.” 2019 R&D Priorities memo (for fiscal year 2021) 2018 R&D Priorities memo (for fiscal year 2020) 2017 R&D Priorities memo (for fiscal year 2019) “The development of artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at a rapid pace, and the 2019 Budget invests in fundamental AI research and computing infrastructure to maintain U.S. leadership in this field. AI holds the potential to transform the lives of Americans through improved technology integration in the workplace and enhanced standards of living at home.” 2019 Budget – Analytical Perspectives R&D Chapter “New technologies include advanced computing, “big data” analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics…— the very technologies that ensure we will be able to fight and win the wars of the future.” “The Department [of Defense] will invest broadly in military application of autonomy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, including rapid application of commercial breakthroughs, to gain competitive military advantages.” National Defense Strategy To improve the coordination of Federal efforts related to AI, the White House chartered a Select Committee on AI under the National Science and Technology Council. The Select Committee consists of the most senior R&D officials across the Federal government and represents a whole-of-government approach to AI R&D planning and coordination. This Committee advises the White House on interagency AI R&D priorities; considers the creation of Federal partnerships with industry and academia; establishes structures to improve government planning and coordination of AI R&D; and identifies opportunities to prioritize and support the national AI R&D ecosystem. The Select Committee also provides guidance and direction to the existing Machine Learning and AI Subcommittee, which serves as the operations and implementation arm of the committee. NSTC Select Committee on AI Charter Guiding the Nation in our AI R&D investments is the  National AI R&D Strategic Plan: 2019 Update , which identifies the critical areas of AI R&D that require Federal investments. Released by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy’s National Science and Technology Council, the Plan defines several key areas of priority focus for the Federal agencies that invest in AI. These areas of strategic AI R&D focus include: continued long-term investments in AI; effective methods for human-AI collaboration; understanding and addressing the ethical, legal, and societal implications for AI; ensuring the safety and security of AI; developing shared public datasets and environments for AI training and testing; measuring and evaluating AI technologies through standards and benchmark; better understanding the National AI R&D workforce needs; and expanding public-private partnerships to accelerate AI advances. The process for creating this Plan began in August of 2018, when the Administration directed the Select Committee on AI to refresh the 2016  National AI R&D Strategic Plan  to account for significant recent advancements in AI, and to ensure that Federal R&D investments remain at the forefront of science and technology. The Select Committee then issued a Request for Information ( RFI ) to solicit input from the public on the current AI R&D Strategic Plan, to determine ways the strategy should be revised or improved. The responses to this RFI, as well as an independent agency review, informed the 2019 update to the Plan. The  National AI R&D Strategic Plan: 2019 Update  defines the priorities for the overall portfolio for Federal AI R&D investments. Federal agencies take these priorities into account when developing their own budget proposals and agency plans, as appropriate to their respective agencies’ missions. This coordinated Federal strategy for AI R&D will help the United States to continue to lead the world in cutting-edge advances in AI that will grow our economy, increase our national security, and improve our quality of life. In September 2019, agencies for the first time reported their nondefense R&D investments in AI according to this Plan, through the  NITRD Supplement to the President’s FY2020 Budget . This new AI R&D reporting process provides an important mechanism and baseline for consistently tracking America’s prioritization of AI R&D going forward.  This report also provides insight into the diverse and extensive range of nondefense Federal AI R&D programs and initiatives. National AI R&D Strategic Plan: 2019 Update NITRD Supplement to the President’s FY2020 Budget Research and development is a top priority of the United States national strategy for AI. To document the impactful progress the nation has made in AI through Federal R&D investments, the White House issued the  2016-2019 Progress Report: Advancing Artificial Intelligence R&D  in November 2019. This progress report illustrates the considerable breadth and depth of Federal investments that are leading to transformative advancements in the state of the field. As a nation, we benefit significantly from the broad spectrum of Federal agencies that invest in AI from their unique mission perspectives, consistent with the national AI R&D strategy. For example, in December 2019 the Department of Veterans Affairs announced its  National AI Institute . With this institute, our country’s AI R&D will benefit from the largest integrated health care system in the country and the largest genomic knowledge base in the world linked to health care information, provided by the VA. These investments are generating impactful breakthroughs that are revolutionizing our society for the better. 
 2016-2019 Progress Report: Advancing Artificial Intelligence R&D, November 2019 While algorithms and data play strong roles in the performance of AI systems, equally important is the computing infrastructure upon which the AI system runs. Advances in AI will continue to be dependent on hardware optimized for AI algorithms, including novel designs for neuromorphic computing, hardware accelerators for machine learning, embedded systems, and parallel architecture research motivated by AI processing requirements. The American AI Initiative calls for federal agencies to allocate high-performance and cloud computing resources to AI-related applications and R&D. The United States is a world leader in the development of high-performance computing infrastructure that supports AI research. In June 2018, the U.S. Department of Energy introduced the  Summit  scientific supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Summit provides unprecedented computer power for research across a broad variety of scientific domains, including artificial intelligence, energy, and advanced materials. Summit also provides unmatched capabilities for integrating AI and scientific discovery. In May 2019, DOE announced plans to build the  Frontier supercomputer , which is expected to debut in 2021 as the world’s most powerful computer that maintains U.S. leadership in high-performance computing and AI. The National Science Foundation (NSF) also invests significantly in the exploration, development, and deployment of a wide range of cyberinfrastructure technologies that can be useful for AI R&D, including next-generation supercomputers. In 2018,  NSF funded the largest and most powerful supercomputer  the agency has ever supported to serve the nation’s science and engineering research community. The new high-performance computing system, called Frontera, will be a system with the highest scale, throughput, and data analysis capabilities ever deployed on a university campus in the United States. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration also has a strong high-end computing program, and is augmenting their  Pleiades supercomputer  with new nodes specifically designed for MLAI workloads.   “Today’s launch of the Summit supercomputer demonstrates the strength of American leadership in scientific innovation and technology development. It’s going to have a profound impact in energy research, scientific discovery, economic competitiveness, and national security,” said Secretary Perry. “Summit will empower scientists to address a wide range of new challenges, accelerate discovery, spur innovation, and above all, benefit the American people.” Rick Perry High quality datasets are critically important for training many types of AI systems. The Federal government facilitates AI innovation by investing in shared public datasets. The American AI Initiative calls for agencies to make Federal data, models, and computing resources more available to America’s AI R&D experts, researchers, and industries. This will be done to foster public trust and increase the value of these resources to AI R&D experts, while maintaining the safety, security, civil liberties, privacy, and confidentiality protections we all expect. These efforts will work in concert with the President’s Management Agenda and implementing the Open, Public, Electronic, and Necessary, (OPEN) Government Data Act. In March of 2018, the President’s Management Agenda laid out a new  Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal  of leveraging data as a strategic asset. This CAP goal will result in the development and implementation of the  Federal Data Strategy , which defines principles, practices, and an action plan to generate a more consistent approach to the use, access, and stewardship of Federal data. In addition, the National Science Foundation is leading in the development of a cohesive, federated, national-scale approach to research data infrastructure through the  Harnessing the Data Revolution  Big Idea. This initiative provides a significant opportunity to transform research across all areas of science and engineering, including AI. Together, these actions will drive our top-notch AI research toward new technological breakthroughs and promote scientific discovery, economic competitiveness, and national security. Standards are essential for ensuring that AI technologies meet critical objectives for functionality and interoperability. The Federal government engages in the development of technical standards and related tools in support of reliable, robust, trustworthy, secure, portable, and interoperable systems that use AI technologies. These activities ensure that technical standards for AI reflect Federal priorities for innovation, public trust, and confidence.  The  National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) is the leader in advancing foundational research in measuring and assessing AI technologies, including the development of AI data standards and best practices, as well as AI evaluation methodologies and standard testing protocols. As directed by the American AI Initiative, NIST  released a plan  in August 2019 for Federal engagement in the development of AI technical standards.

					 Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative Pillars 1 Women Prospering in the Workforce 2 Women Succeeding as Entrepreneurs 3 Women Enabled in the Economy When women are economically empowered, they re-invest in their families and communities, producing a multiplier effect that spurs economic growth and contributes to global peace and stability. In February 2019, President Trump established the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative, also led and created by Advisor to the President, Ivanka Trump. This initiative is the first whole-of-government effort to advance global women’s economic empowerment. W-GDP seeks to reach 50 million women in the developing world by 2025 through U.S. government activities, private-public partnerships, and a new, innovative W-GDP Fund. In its first year, W-GDP reached 12 million women worldwide.  The W-GDP Initiative aims to enhance opportunities for women to participate meaningfully in the economy and advance both prosperity and national security. W-GDP focuses on three pillars: Women Prospering in the Workforce, Women Succeeding as Entrepreneurs, and Women Enabled in the Economy. 3 Promote an enabling environment that increases women’s economic empowerment by reducing barriers and enhancing protections in policies, laws, regulations and practices (public and private) to facilitate women’s participation in the economy. The environment for economic activity in any country often includes numerous barriers that disadvantage women as they pursue employment, business, and investment opportunities. Broadly defined, the enabling environment for women in the economy encompasses the legal and regulatory framework, policies and practices (public and private sector), and social norms that support women to operate in the formal economy, or improve basic conditions for women working in the informal economy. Conversely, each of these factors, if not addressed, can stunt women’s economic empowerment. Women are frequently discouraged and often effectively barred from economic engagement by disproportionate burdens of unpaid care, gender-based violence, underinvestment in their education, need for spousal approval for employment, and legal barriers to participation in certain professions. Some of the economic barriers women face arise from foundational limitations, such as laws that limit women’s rights to inherit, own property, or enter contracts in their own name. Reducing those barriers while ensuring women have the legal and policy protections they need requires deliberate efforts by government, private sector, and civil society. Examining legal barriers specifically,  W-GDP is focusing its efforts on five foundational factors  that include women’s ability to access institutions, build credit, manage property, travel freely, and work in the same sectors and jobs as men. Accessing Institutions: Reduce restrictions on women’s authority to sign legal documents such as contracts and court documents. Address unequal access to courts and administrative bodies for women, whether officially or though lack of proper enforcement. Building Credit: Ensure women’s equal access to credit and capital to start and grow their businesses. Prohibit discrimination in accessing credit by sex or marital status. Owning and Managing Property: Lift restrictions for women on owning and managing property, including limitations on inheritance and the ability to transfer, purchase, or lease property. Traveling Freely: Address constraints on women’s freedom of movement, including restrictions on obtaining passports. Removing Restrictions on Employment: Remove restrictions that limit women’s working hours, occupations, or tasks. The benefits of women in the economy are substantial. Countries with greater balance of men and women in the workplace and workforce have greater growth, innovation, and stability. The same goes for firms: those with a stronger ratio of women in leadership, management, and the workforce outperform those with fewer women. While only five percent of the CEOs in Africa are women, the positive impact of female leadership is clear: businesses in Africa with the most women on their boards have an operating profit over 20 percent higher than industry averages. Improvements in the enabling environment increase economic opportunities for all women in that economy, which in turn benefits their families, communities, firms, and nations as a whole through broad-based economic growth and development. The larger the opportunity gap between men and women, the more likely a country is to be involved in violent conflict. Conversely, nations in which women have equal opportunities are more likely to thrive and solve challenges peacefully. Women’s economic empowerment and equality exists when the enabling environment reduces the barriers women face to participating in the economy, whether those are legal, regulatory or cultural. Accelerating women’s economic empowerment around the world is integral to enabling developing countries to achieve economic self-reliance.

			 The data-driven conditions each region or state should satisfy
	before proceeding to a phased opening. What States should do to meet the challenges ahead. Responsibilities of individuals and employers during all phases,
	and in each specific phase of the opening. Satisfy Before Proceeding to Phased Comeback Downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) reported within a 14-day period AND Downward trajectory of covid-like syndromic cases reported within a 14-day period Downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period OR Downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period (flat or increasing volume of tests) Treat all patients without crisis care AND Robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody testing State and local officials may need to tailor the application of these criteria to local circumstances (e.g., metropolitan areas that have suffered severe COVID outbreaks, rural and suburban areas where outbreaks have not occurred or have been mild).  Additionally, where appropriate, Governors should work on a regional basis to satisfy these criteria and to progress through the phases outlined below. Ability to quickly set up safe and efficient screening and testing sites for symptomatic individuals and trace contacts of COVID+ results Ability to test Syndromic/ILI-indicated persons for COVID and trace contacts of COVID+ results Ensure sentinel surveillance sites are screening for asymptomatic cases and contacts for COVID+ results are traced (sites operate at locations that serve older individuals, lower-income Americans, racial minorities, and Native Americans) Ability to quickly and independently supply sufficient Personal Protective Equipment and critical medical equipment to handle dramatic surge in need Ability to surge ICU capacity Protect the health and safety of workers in critical industries Protect the health and safety of those living and working in high-risk facilities (e.g., senior care facilities) Protect employees and users of mass transit Advise citizens regarding protocols for social distancing and face coverings Monitor conditions and immediately take steps to limit and mitigate any rebounds or outbreaks by restarting a phase or returning to an earlier phase, depending on severity BASED ON  UP-TO-DATE DATA  AND READINESS MITIGATES  RISK OF RESURGENCE PROTECTS  THE MOST VULNERABLE IMPLEMENTABLE ON  STATEWIDE OR COUNTY-BY-COUNTY  BASIS AT GOVERNORS' DISCRETION Guidelines for All Phases Continue to adhere to State and local guidance as well as complementary CDC guidance, particularly with respect to face coverings. Wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer, especially after touching frequently used items or surfaces. Avoid touching your face. Sneeze or cough into a tissue, or the inside of your elbow. Disinfect frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible. Strongly consider using face coverings while in public, and particularly when using mass transit. Do not go to work or school. Contact and follow the advice of your medical provider. Guidelines for All Phases Develop and implement appropriate policies, in accordance with Federal, State, and local regulations and guidance, and informed by industry best practices, regarding: Social distancing and protective equipment Temperature checks Sanitation Use and disinfection of common and high-traffic areas Business travel Monitor workforce for indicative symptoms. Do not allow symptomatic people to physically return to work until cleared by a medical provider. Develop and implement policies and procedures for workforce contact tracing following employee COVID+ test. For States and Regions that satisfy the gating criteria ALL  VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS  should continue to shelter in place.  Members of households with vulnerable residents should be aware that by returning to work or other environments where distancing is not practical, they could carry the virus back home.  Precautions should be taken to isolate from vulnerable residents. All individuals,  WHEN IN PUBLIC  (e.g., parks, outdoor recreation areas, shopping areas), should maximize physical distance from others.  Social settings of more than 10 people, where appropriate distancing may not be practical, should be avoided unless precautionary measures are observed. Avoid  SOCIALIZING  in groups of more than 10 people in circumstances that do not readily allow for appropriate physical distancing (e.g., receptions, trade shows) MINIMIZE NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL  and adhere to CDC guidelines regarding isolation following travel. Continue to  ENCOURAGE TELEWORK , whenever possible and feasible with business operations. If possible,  RETURN TO WORK IN PHASES . Close  COMMON AREAS  where personnel are likely to congregate and interact, or enforce strict social distancing protocols. Minimize  NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL  and adhere to CDC guidelines regarding isolation following travel. Strongly consider  SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS  for personnel who are members of a  VULNERABLE POPULATION . SCHOOLS AND ORGANIZED YOUTH ACTIVITIES  (e.g., daycare, camp) that are currently closed should remain closed. VISITS TO SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS  should be prohibited.  Those who do interact with residents and patients must adhere to strict protocols regarding hygiene. LARGE VENUES  (e.g., sit-down dining, movie theaters, sporting venues, places of worship) can operate under strict physical distancing protocols. ELECTIVE SURGERIES  can resume, as clinically appropriate, on an outpatient basis at facilities that adhere to CMS guidelines. GYMS  can open if they adhere to strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols. BARS  should remain closed. For States and Regions with no evidence of a rebound and that satisfy the gating criteria a second time ALL  VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS  should continue to shelter in place.  Members of households with vulnerable residents should be aware that by returning to work or other environments where distancing is not practical, they could carry the virus back home.  Precautions should be taken to isolate from vulnerable residents. All individuals,  WHEN IN PUBLIC  (e.g., parks, outdoor recreation areas, shopping areas), should maximize physical distance from others.  Social settings of more than 50 people, where appropriate distancing may not be practical, should be avoided unless precautionary measures are observed. NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL  can resume. Continue to  ENCOURAGE TELEWORK , whenever possible and feasible with business operations. Close  COMMON AREAS  where personnel are likely to congregate and interact, or enforce moderate social distancing protocols. Strongly consider  SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS  for personnel who are members of a  VULNERABLE POPULATION . SCHOOLS AND ORGANIZED YOUTH ACTIVITIES  (e.g., daycare, camp) can reopen. VISITS TO SENIOR CARE FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS  should be prohibited.  Those who do interact with residents and patients must adhere to strict protocols regarding hygiene. LARGE VENUES  (e.g., sit-down dining, movie theaters, sporting venues, places of worship) can operate under moderate physical distancing protocols. ELECTIVE SURGERIES  can resume, as clinically appropriate, on an outpatient and in-patient basis at facilities that adhere to CMS guidelines. GYMS  can remain open if they adhere to strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols. BARS  may operate with diminished standing-room occupancy, where applicable and appropriate. For States and Regions with no evidence of a rebound and that satisfy the gating criteria a third time VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS  can resume public interactions, but should practice physical distancing, minimizing exposure to social settings where distancing may not be practical, unless precautionary measures are observed. LOW-RISK POPULATIONS  should consider minimizing time spent in crowded environments. Resume  UNRESTRICTED STAFFING  of worksites. VISITS TO SENIOR CARE FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS  can resume.  Those who interact with residents and patients must be diligent regarding hygiene. LARGE VENUES  (e.g., sit-down dining, movie theaters, sporting venues, places of worship) can  operate under limited physical distancing protocols. GYMS  can remain open if they adhere to standard sanitation protocols. BARS  may operate with increased standing room occupancy, where applicable. Appendix 1. Elderly individuals. 2.

					 Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative Pillars 1 Women Prospering in the Workforce 2 Women Succeeding as Entrepreneurs 3 Women Enabled in the Economy When women are economically empowered, they re-invest in their families and communities, producing a multiplier effect that spurs economic growth and contributes to global peace and stability. In February 2019, President Trump established the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative, also led and created by Advisor to the President, Ivanka Trump. This initiative is the first whole-of-government effort to advance global women’s economic empowerment. W-GDP seeks to reach 50 million women in the developing world by 2025 through U.S. government activities, private-public partnerships, and a new, innovative W-GDP Fund. In its first year, W-GDP reached 12 million women worldwide.  The W-GDP Initiative aims to enhance opportunities for women to participate meaningfully in the economy and advance both prosperity and national security. W-GDP focuses on three pillars: Women Prospering in the Workforce, Women Succeeding as Entrepreneurs, and Women Enabled in the Economy. Societies that empower women to participate fully in civic and economic life are more prosperous and peaceful. White House Logo

					 On February 11, 2019, President Trump signed Executive Order 13859 announcing the American AI Initiative — the United States’ national strategy on artificial intelligence. This strategy is a concerted effort to promote and protect national AI technology and innovation. The Initiative implements a whole-of-government strategy in collaboration and engagement with the private sector, academia, the public, and like-minded international partners. It directs the Federal government to pursue five pillars for advancing AI: (1) invest in AI research and development (R&D), (2) unleash AI resources, (3) remove barriers to AI innovation, (4) train an AI-ready workforce, and (5) promote an international environment that is supportive of American AI innovation and its responsible use. The U.S. is also actively leveraging AI to help the Federal government work smarter in its own services and missions in trustworthy ways. In February 2020, the White House released the  American Artificial Intelligence Initiative: Year  One  Annual Report .  In the year since the AI Executive Order was signed, the Administration called for record amounts of AI R&D investment, led the development of the first international statement on AI Principles, issued the first-ever strategy for engagement in AI technical standards, published the first-ever reporting of government-wide non-defense AI R&D spending, and released the first-ever AI regulatory document for the trustworthy development, testing, deployment, and adoption of AI technologies.   The AI Executive Order Summary of the AI Executive Order Op-Ed on the AI Executive Order Fact Sheet on the AI Executive Order American AI Initiative: Year One Annual Report In September 2019, The White House hosted the Summit on Artificial Intelligence in Government to spark ideas for how the Federal government can adopt AI to better achieve its mission and improve services to the American people. Over 175 leaders and experts from government, industry, and academia came together to identify best practices in the use of AI, opportunities to foster collaborative partnerships, and ways to develop a Federal AI workforce. The Summit highlighted innovative efforts at Federal agencies that have already adopted AI, and looked ahead to future transformative AI applications that will make government more effective, efficient, and responsive. Summary of 2019 White House Summit on AI in Government In May 2018, The White House hosted the Summit on Artificial Intelligence for American Industry to discuss the promise of AI and the policies needed to realize that promise for the American people and maintain U.S. leadership in the age of AI. The summit brought together over 100 senior government officials, technical experts from top academic institutions, heads of industrial research labs, and American business leaders who are adopting AI technologies to benefit their customers, workers, and shareholders. At this summit, participants engaged in two sets of breakout sessions focused on cross-cutting issues such as AI R&D, workforce development, regulatory barriers to AI innovation, and sector-specific applications of AI.

					 AI innovation can be hampered or driven overseas by overly restrictive government regulations. We will create a national climate where scientists and technologists successfully develop their new AI inventions here in the United States. Under this Administration, we are removing regulatory and other barriers to the safe development and testing of AI technologies, to enable the creation of new AI-based industries and the adoption of AI by existing industries. In January 2020, the White House proposed  AI regulatory principles  for the use of AI in the private sector. These transparent regulatory principles, which are open for public comment, are designed to achieve three goals: ensure public engagement, limit regulatory overreach and promote trustworthy technology. In concert, agencies are developing regulatory and non-regulatory approaches for innovative uses of AI while also upholding civil liberties, privacy, and American values. Examples of these approaches include the Department of Transportation’s work to safely integrate driverless cars onto traditional roadways, the FDA’s approval of the first ever AI-based device for medical diagnostics, and the FAA’s work to speed the integration of unmanned aerial systems into the Nation’s airspace. Additionally, the  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  is exploring intellectual property policy considerations of AI. The Federal government welcomes additional ideas from the American public on barriers that can be removed to speed AI innovation while also protecting privacy, civil liberties, and the safety of the American public.

 Autonomous systems, such as unmanned aircraft systems (drones) and self-driving vehicles, offer tremendous benefits to our economy and society. They promise to transform the delivery of household goods, provide mobility options for senior citizens and Americans with disabilities, improve the safety of dangerous occupations, and expand access to life-saving medical supplies. In partnership with State and local governments, the Trump Administration, through the Department of Transportation and NASA, is working to enable the safe operation of these systems on our roadways and in our airspace. “It shall be the policy of the United States to promote the safe operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and enable the development of UAS technologies for use in agriculture, commerce, emergency management, human transportation, and other sectors.” President Donald J. Trump On October 25, 2017, President Trump signed a  Presidential Memorandum  directing Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao to establish an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) integration pilot program (IPP), which the President signed into law with the 2018 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act. Two weeks later, Secretary Chao announced the creation of the  UAS IPP  to develop and safely test the further integration of UAS in a select number of State, local, and tribal jurisdictions. Over the following months, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) heard from more than 2,500 interested parties, with more than 300 state, local, and tribal governments interested in taking part. On May 10, 2018, Secretary Chao announced the selection of  ten program awardees , spanning the continental United States and Alaska. These awardees are conducting a range of novel and innovative UAS operations, including pairing drones with 5G test networks, eradicating pestilent mosquito populations, and delivering life-saving medical equipment in emergency situations. Data gathered from these pilot projects will form the basis of a new regulatory framework. In January 2019,  FAA announced  proposed new rules to allow drones to fly at night and over people without waivers under certain conditions and to further integrate drones safely into the national airspace system. FAA also announced the Unmanned Aircraft System Safe and Secure Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This proposal identifies major drone safety and security issues that may pose a threat to other aircraft, to people on the ground, or to national security. It is soliciting recommendations to reduce these risks as drones are integrated into our national airspace. The FAA has established the  UAS Data Exchange , a collaborative approach to facilitate the sharing of airspace data between government and industry, which has already led to shortened processing times for airspace authorizations for UAS operators. In coordination with the FAA, NASA continues development of a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system, and in May 2018 released Version 1.0 of the  UTM Concept of Operations .   FAA Recent UAS Initiatives “UAS present opportunities to enhance the safety of the American public, increase the efficiency and productivity of American industry, and create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” President Donald J. Trump The development and deployment of automated vehicles (AV) and automated driving systems (ADS), have the potential to reduce the number and severity of serious automobile crashes. Over 90 percent of these crashes are due to human error, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and automation can help in preventing injuries and saving lives. The market for automated vehicles is anticipated to be over $40 billion in 2025 and more than $75 billion in 2035. In addition, fully automated vehicles have the potential to present new transportation options for older Americans and those with disabilities, increasing their connectivity and independence. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is taking active steps to develop guidance for how best to integrate automated vehicles and driving systems into our transportation system. In January 2020, DOT released “ Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies: Automated Vehicles 4.0, ” which details ten U.S. Government principles to protect users and communities, to promote efficient markets, and to facilitate coordinated efforts to ensure a standardized Federal approach to American leadership. This new document builds off of the Department’s  2018 AV 3.0 guidance  and  2017 ADS 2.0 guidance , which focused on innovation for surface transportation modes, and safe testing and integration of Automated Driving Systems, respectively. Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies: Automated Vehicles 4.0 “The safe deployment of automated vehicle technologies means we can look forward to a future with fewer traffic fatalities and increased mobility for all Americans.” 
 Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao Healthcare 
 As new diseases emerge and old ones evolve, the Trump Administration is actively investing in ways to advance cutting-edge medical research. Sepsis, a condition that claims  250,000 American lives each year  is a national health security threat. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is promoting medical innovation through the Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe).  By offering partnerships with public and private institutions , the HHS seeks to provide innovative solutions to sepsis by introducing machine learning algorithms to treat the disease. HHS also worked on a  Health Tech Sprint  to show how AI can be applied to Federal data to create products for healthcare applications. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS’) Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) has launched the  Artificial Intelligence (AI) Health Outcomes Challenge , in collaboration with the American Academy of Family Physicians and the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. The CMS AI Health Outcomes Challenge will distribute up to $1.65 million to encourage further progress in AI for health and health care and to accelerate development of real-world applications for this technology.  Participants will analyze large health care data sets and develop proposals, AI driven models, and frameworks that accurately predict unplanned hospital and SNF admissions and adverse events. In an effort to remove barriers to AI innovation in 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed,  for the first time , the marketing of artificial intelligence technology that can detect eye problems caused by diabetes. In the same year, the FDA also permitted marketing of  AI-based software  that can help healthcare providers detect wrist fractures more quickly. In addition, the FDA along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered to advance research in machine learning and natural language processing by  creating free tools that will improve the collection of clinical data . In 2019, the FDA began developing a total product lifecycle-based adaptive framework for  smart software in medical devices , such as electrocardiogram (EKG) devices that estimate the probability of a heart attack. The National Institutes of Health is exploring many opportunities for  AI to accelerate medical advances in biomedical research . NIH has large data sets resulting from projects such as the NIH Human Microbiome Project and the All of Us Research Program. These data sets provide great opportunity for AI to foster discovery. In 2019, reports on work funded by NIH, researchers were able to use  AI to catch irregular heartbeats , indicating that AI can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of EKG readings. NIH has recently launched a working group on AI to explore ways to make the best use of existing data, and harness the potential of AI to advance biomedical research and the practice of medicine.

“The Software Precertification Program is envisioned as a voluntary pathway that embodies a regulatory model more tailored than the current regulatory paradigm to assess the safety and effectiveness of software technologies without inhibiting patient access to these technologies.” Manufacturing 
 State-of-the-art advances in manufacturing help our economy and empower our workforce. In July of 2018, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) identified manufacturing areas such as chemical manufacturing, advanced robotics and artificial intelligence, aircraft parts, integrated circuits, space and exploration technology, etc., as areas under threat from foreign espionage.  In the face of intense global competition, President Trump unveiled a  National Strategic Plan on Advanced Manufacturing  in October 2018 that focuses on defending the economy, expanding manufacturing employment, and ensuring a strong manufacturing and defense industrial base and a resilient supply chain. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is working to provide the tools to move our industries into the smart manufacturing generation. By developing automated, distributed sensing, and autonomous control systems, the Trump Administration wants to increase the operational efficiency of factories across the United States.  In April of 2018, and for the first time ever, NIST published guidelines and best practices for introducing wireless technology into smart manufacturing. Our leadership in modern manufacturing comes with economic threats such as those related to cybersecurity. “Optimism among American manufacturers has hit all-time highs as American businesses across the country have paid bonuses, increased wages, and boosted contributions to employee retirement plans.” –  President Donald Trump (07/17/18) ORNL’s MDF Industry Collaboration Program 
This program connects industry partners with national laboratory and academic experts to test and implement state-of-the-art technologies for manufacturing processes. High Performance Computing for Manufacturing (HPC4Mfg) Program 
The DOE’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is home to the High Performance Computing for Manufacturing (HPC4Mfg) Program. The goal of this program is to bring industry manufacturers to use high-performance computing to develop simulations that will advance manufacturing technology. Financial Services 
 Under the leadership of President Trump, the United States’ economy is growing at a fast pace. The Department of the Treasury is pursuing policies that promote the adoption of innovating tools such as AI and machine learning while  removing unnecessary regulatory barriers . These new tools will empower the American people by helping them make more informed decisions about their short-term and long-term financial goals.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is actively implementing  machine learning algorithms  to monitor and detect potential investment market misconduct. Additionally, in September 2019, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)  issued new policies  that allow for an increased use of data and machine learning algorithms in financial products and services.  These policies will help unleash innovation in the financial sector, driving competition that lowers prices and provides consumers with more and better products and services.  New approaches can also expand access to the benefits of the financial system for Americans of all backgrounds. “Financial institutions have been improving their ability to monitor transactions and conduct link analysis with new technologies that rely on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Being proactive on this front is more important than ever in your sector given the sophisticated ways actors use to move money and goods. We applaud efforts to use new technologies to identify and build out networks and make better decisions about who you should and should not be doing business with.” CFPB Policies to Facilitate Compliance and Promote Innovation Artificial Intelligence. Emerging Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications This Report to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House of Representatives highlights, among other items, the benefits and challenges of deploying artificial intelligence technologies to financial services. Agriculture 
 Confronting one of the biggest challenges facing agriculture today—feeding an additional 2 billion people by 2050—the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA) is positioning farmers, scientists, educators, and the American public to benefit from artificial intelligence, providing economic opportunitay through innovation, helping rural America to thrive, and promoting more efficient and profitable agricultural production. NIFA has launched a data science initiative,  Food and Agriculture Cyberinformatics and Tools , to accelerate and expand on a diverse portfolio of AI-related programs that represent a multitude of uses in agricultural production, sensor development, bioinformatics, ecosystem management, rural community support, and workforce development through education and training at all levels. This work includes robotic solutions that utilize AI technologies to assist in pollination, weeding, pesticide applications, and fruit harvesting; AI algorithms that assist in identifying plant, animal and tree species that contribute to pest control and ecosystem management; and adaptive groundwater and watershed models to maintain resilience of agricultural systems. NIFA’s investments contribute to a wide breadth of AI-relevant research including big data, machine learning, autonomous systems, computer vision and intelligent decision support systems, as well as the socioeconomic and workforce considerations with rapidly increasing role of AI in U.S. agriculture. ARS is collaborating with industry to advance the role of AI in monitoring livestock, using robots to sort harvests, analyzing irrigation systems, and utilizing UAV technology to analyze crop health and efficiently apply pesticides. Their programs include the use of automated calculations to analyze crop foliage composition and then guide the application of pesticides; self-propelled apple sorting machines that use algorithms to quality sort the fruit; and aerial monitoring of fungi levels on corn and other crops using computer vision and deep learning. ERS is conducting research and development to use machine learning and AI to create better crop yield models based on weather data and analysis. USDA’s work in AI and data science brings revolutionary technology to agriculture with the potential to transform our ability to bring high-quality food to America’s dinner table. Weather Forecasting 
 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is using AI to better understand and predict the dynamic environment we live in. The American AI Initiative prioritizes research and development investments, along with data and computational infrastructure, that will accelerate the ability of researchers to create AI that can assimilate the massive amounts of big data from our environmental satellites into our weather models to improve predictions of hurricanes and severe storms. AI capabilities, including sensors on aerial and underwater drones led to record setting accuracy in forecasts for Hurricane Florence that led to over 200,000 lifesaving evacuations 4 days before the storm made landfall. Other applications of AI by NOAA include improving nautical charts to ensure safe and efficient maritime commerce, surveying fish stocks to effectively manage our nation’s $208B/year recreational and commercial fishing industries, monitoring and conserving endangered species, and exploring, mapping, and monitoring the world’s ocean conditions and coasts for critical national security and economic applications. NOAA also uses onboard AI and machine learning techniques in NOAA satellites help protect the environmental spacecraft during radiation events that could corrupt satellite computers. Automated software checks built into the onboard system can detect charged particles passing through onboard electronics, and then initiate contingency procedures to clear error conditions and help return satellites to full functionality. “NOAA, in cooperation with academia and the private sector, is riding the wave of exponential improvements in Artificial Intelligence to dramatically advance our mission to protect life and property and empower the nation’s economy” 
 NOAA Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet, USN (retired) National Security & Defense 
 On December 18, 2017, President Trump signed a new  National Security Strategy  that calls on America to lead in research, technology, invention, and innovation in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence. The Trump Administration’s commitment to AI is exemplified in the  National Defense Strategy , where the Administration states its intent to invest broadly in military application of AI and machine learning alongside other emerging technologies. The Administration’s commitment to advanced AI R&D is evident in the  FY 2020 Administration Research and Development Budget Priorities  memo, which calls for investment in AI, quantum information science, and strategic computing as critical components of our national security. In June 2018, the DoD established the  Joint Artificial Intelligence Center  (JAIC) to serve as the focal point in the use of AI for key defense missions. The JAIC accelerates the delivery of AI-enabled capabilities, scales the DoD-wide impact of AI, and synchronizes the DoD’s AI activities. The JAIC further aims to spur momentum in the use of AI for DoD by focusing on a set of challenging use cases that can benefit from AI, including perception, predictive maintenance, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and cyber sensemaking, all detailed at  ai.mil . The JAIC’s mission is to both deliver new AI-enabled capabilities to DoD end users, as well as to incrementally develop a common foundation of shared data, reusable tools, frameworks, libraries, and standards that are essential for scaling the impact of AI across DoD. In February 2019, the Department of Defense released its  DoD AI Strategy , which focuses efforts on harnessing AI to advance our Nation’s security and prosperity. The DoD AI Strategy defines the JAIC as the focal point of DoD’s AI efforts, and outlines on the following key strategic aims: delivering AI-enabled capabilities for key missions; partnering with leading private sector technology companies, academia, and global allies; cultivating a leading AI workforce; and leading in military ethics and AI safety. Similarly in the intelligence community (IC), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) released in January 2019 the  Augmenting Intelligence using Machines (AIM) Initiative .  With scale in mind, the IC is enhancing its ability to provide much-needed data interpretation to decision makers across government.  “The impact of AI will extend across the entire Department, spanning from operations and training to recruiting and healthcare. The speed and agility with which we will deliver AI capabilities to the warfighter has the potential to change the character of warfare. We must accelerate the adoption of AI-enabled capabilities to strengthen our military, improve effectiveness and efficiency, and enhance the security of our nation.”

					 Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve a future of peace and prosperity. A realistic two-state solution will protect Israel’s security, fulfill the aspirations of self-determination for the Palestinian people, and ensure universal and respectful access to the holy sites of Jerusalem. This Vision would achieve mutual recognition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people and the future state of Palestine as the nation-state of the Palestinian people—each with equal civil rights for all its citizens. The plan designates defensible borders for the State of Israel and does not ask Israel to compromise on the safety of its people, affording them overriding security responsibility for land west of the Jordan River. For Palestinians, the Vision delivers significant territorial expansion, allocating land roughly comparable in size to the West Bank and Gaza for establishing a Palestinian State. Transportation links would allow efficient movement between Gaza and the West Bank, as well as throughout a future Palestine. The plan does not call for uprooting any Israelis or Palestinians from their homes.

					 Artificial Intelligence for the American People 01 02 03 04 05 The age of artificial intelligence (AI) has arrived, and is transforming everything from healthcare to transportation to manufacturing. America has long been the global leader in this new era of AI, and is poised to maintain this leadership going forward because of our strong innovation ecosystem. Realizing the full potential of AI for the Nation requires the combined efforts of industry, academia, and government. The Administration has been active in developing policies and implementing strategies that accelerate AI innovation in the U.S. for the benefit of the American people. These activities align with several areas of emphasis: AI for American Innovation, AI for American Industry, AI for the American Worker, and AI with American Values. This AI.gov website provides a portal for exploring these activities in more depth, and serves as a resource for those who want to learn more about how to take full advantage of the opportunities of AI. “Continued American leadership in Artificial Intelligence is of paramount importance to maintaining the economic and national security of the United States.” 
 – President Donald J. Trump 04

					 The American worker is a vital national asset, and advances in technology are changing the American workforce. Artificial intelligence is allowing American companies to focus resources on higher value work while enabling American workers to accomplish tasks more safely, effectively, and efficiently. The Nation also needs highly-skilled workers in industry and academia who can contribute to the R&D advances that create the AI of the future. The American AI Initiative calls for agencies to prioritize fellowship and training programs to help American workers gain AI-relevant skills through apprenticeships, skills programs, fellowships, and education in computer science and other growing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. The Initiative also leverages the extensive set of actions already underway to provide education and training opportunities for America’s workers. Through an executive order establishing the National Council for the American Worker, President Trump has charged companies and trade groups across the country to sign a pledge committing to expand education, training, and reskilling opportunities for American workers — as of February 2019 over 200 companies have  pledged  to create over six and a half million such opportunities. The Trump administration has also led several initiatives recognizing apprenticeships, STEM education, and lifelong learning as essential to America’s future workforce strategy. Created by executive order, the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion brought private industry and government together to identify opportunities that would expand industry-recognized apprenticeships—the Task Force made 26 recommendations to the President for consideration. Additionally, through Presidential Memorandum to the Secretary of Education, President Trump has identified STEM education as an Administration priority, establishing a goal of no less than $200 million in grant funding per year to the promotion of high-quality Computer Science and STEM education. To ensure the Nation also has highly-skilled experts who can advance the AI technologies of the future, the Select Committee on AI has prioritized funding to train the next generation of American AI researchers.  The Federal R&D agencies have a number of fellowships to support graduate and postdoctoral studies in AI. As automation and AI become more prevalent, allowing Americans to work more efficiently and safely, the American workforce and industry must embrace lifelong learning as the way of the future. The Trump administration is committed to smart workforce initiatives that protect the American worker as a vital national asset while promoting the emerging technologies of tomorrow. As advances in technology, automation, and AI change the national economy, so too must the country’s education and job training programs change to prepare Americans for the new economy and the emerging industries of the future. President Trump’s July 2018 executive order established the President’s National Council for the American Worker. This Council recognizes skilled American workers as our country’s most valuable resource and works to raise awareness of urgent workforce issues and develop a national strategy for empowering American workers with affordable education and skills-based training for the jobs of today and of the future. On March 6, 2019, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and President Trump’s Advisor Ivanka Trump officially launched the creation of the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board. This board will work together with the National Council for the American Worker to create a national strategy ensuring that all Americans have the skills and opportunity to secure good paying jobs and successfully navigate technological disruptions and the rapidly changing nature of work. The National Council for the American Worker Executive Order Fact Sheet on Workforce Development On June 15, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order, Expanding Apprenticeships in America, which established the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion. This task force, led by Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta, worked throughout the year “to identify strategies and proposals to promote apprenticeships, especially in sectors where apprenticeship programs are insufficient.” Through four subcommittees ranging from education and credentialing to regulatory strategies, the Task Force presented its final report to President Trump on May 10, 2018 with 26 recommendations to promote apprenticeships for American workers. The Expanding Apprenticeships Executive Order Apprenticeship Task Force Summary Apprenticeship Task Force Final Report In December 2018, the National Science and Technology Council’s Committee on STEM Education (CoSTEM) released the  Federal 5-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan , which outlines the goals for American STEM education. These goals include building a strong foundation of STEM literacy, increasing diversity in STEM careers, and preparing the STEM workforce of the future. In September 2017, President Trump signed a  Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Education , which emphasizes STEM education as a key Administration priority, establishing a goal of devoting at least $200 million in grant funds per year to the promotion of high-quality Computer Science and STEM education. Addressing both shortages in STEM teachers at all levels and expanding access to Computer Science and STEM education, the NSTC CoSTEM is the Administration’s vehicle to execute policy on this central element of American leadership in AI. 5-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan Summary from 2018 STEM Education Summit With the Executive Order on AI, President Trump emphasized the importance of training the next generation of AI researchers.  Federal departments and agencies that invest in AI R&D have defined AI as a priority area within Federal fellowship, training, and service programs.  Opportunities are provided at all levels of advanced training, including for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career academic AI researchers. Fellowship, training, and service programs: NASA: STEM Engagement NSF: The National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) NIST:  NRC Postdoctoral Research Associateships Program NIST: Graduate Student Measurement Science and Engineering (GMSE) Fellowship Program NIST: Professional Research Experience Program (PREP) DoD: National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship DOE: Computational Science Graduate Fellowship State: Jefferson Science Fellows program USDA/NIFA:  Education and Workforce Development program USDA/NIFA:  National Needs Graduate and Postgraduate Fellowship Grants Program USDA/NIFA: Higher Education Multicultural Scholars Program The National Science Foundation leads the way on  Advanced Technological Education  (ATE), publishing a program solicitation to award grants totaling $66 million during FY19. The ATE program partners with academic institutions and industry to improve the education of technicians vital to our nation’s economy. Additionally, NSF’s “Big Idea” on “ Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier ” is informing AI-related elements of NSF’s long-term research agenda.

	 The White House is pleased to share President Trump’s Vision for a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. This Vision is the most realistic solution to a problem that has plagued the region for far too long. It creates a path to prosperity, security, and dignity for all involved. If the parties can agree on this framework as a basis for negotiations, the potential for both the Israelis and the Palestinians and the region is unlimited.

					 Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative Pillars 1 Women Prospering in the Workforce 2 Women Succeeding as Entrepreneurs 3 Women Enabled in the Economy When women are economically empowered, they re-invest in their families and communities, producing a multiplier effect that spurs economic growth and contributes to global peace and stability. In February 2019, President Trump established the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative, also led and created by Advisor to the President, Ivanka Trump. This initiative is the first whole-of-government effort to advance global women’s economic empowerment. W-GDP seeks to reach 50 million women in the developing world by 2025 through U.S. government activities, private-public partnerships, and a new, innovative W-GDP Fund. In its first year, W-GDP reached 12 million women worldwide.  The W-GDP Initiative aims to enhance opportunities for women to participate meaningfully in the economy and advance both prosperity and national security. W-GDP focuses on three pillars: Women Prospering in the Workforce, Women Succeeding as Entrepreneurs, and Women Enabled in the Economy. 1 Increase women’s global labor force participation and advancement in the workplace by providing women with quality education, training, and support, so they can secure and thrive in well-paying jobs in their local economies. A healthy global economy is critical to America’s economic and national security, and depends upon the economic contributions of both women and men. Around the world, women’s labor force participation rates are unequal to men’s, decent work opportunities are far too limited, and significant gender pay gaps in the labor market remain. Growing evidence reveals that women’s low participation in the formal labor markets of developing countries impedes economic growth and poverty reduction. Many women face multiple barriers when trying to enter, remain, or advance in the workforce. The problem starts early, as societal norms and expectations often keep girls and women from pursuing education and skills training. Globally, women are more likely than men to shoulder the time burden of unpaid activities, such as cleaning the home, caring for children and elders, and collecting clean water. These practices often prevent them from obtaining education, training, and skills needed to enter into higher-wage, high-growth occupations, such as science, technology, engineering, and math (“STEM”) where men are disproportionately employed. For instance, women make up nearly half of the agricultural labor force in many African countries, but without equal access to adequate training and certifications, women are often working in the lowest-paid roles and tending low-value crops. With a more level playing field, female farmers could increase their yields, feeding their families and more people around the globe. Women also face less access to digital services, which can be a platform for training, employment, and financial services, facilitating women’s economic empowerment. More than 1.7 billion women in low and middle-income countries still do not own a mobile phone, and they are 26% less likely to use mobile internet than men. These factors reinforce women’s economic inequality. Women’s economic empowerment and equality exist in the workforce when women receive the same market-relevant education and vocational opportunities as men and boys, and, once in the workforce, have the ability to organize work for enhanced productivity and compete on equal terms for job openings, advancement, and retention with equal pay for work. Societies that empower women to participate fully in civic and economic life are more prosperous and peaceful. White House Logo
